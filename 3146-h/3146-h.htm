<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>This slightly-built romance was the outcome of a wish to set
the emotional history of two infinitesimal lives against the
stupendous background of the stellar universe, and to impart to
readers the sentiment that of these contrasting magnitudes the
smaller might be the greater to them as men.</p>
<p>But, on the publication of the book people seemed to be less
struck with these high aims of the author than with their own
opinion, first, that the novel was an &lsquo;improper&rsquo; one
in its morals, and, secondly, that it was intended to be a satire
on the Established Church of this country.&nbsp; I was made to
suffer in consequence from several eminent pens.</p>
<p>That, however, was thirteen years ago, and, in respect of the
first opinion, I venture to think that those who care to read the
story now will be quite astonished at the scrupulous propriety
observed therein on the relations of the sexes; for though there
may be frivolous, and even grotesque touches on occasion, there
is hardly a single caress in the book outside legal matrimony, or
what was intended so to be.</p>
<p>As for the second opinion, it is sufficient to draw attention,
as I did at the time, to the fact that the Bishop is every inch a
gentleman, and that the parish priest who figures in the
narrative is one of its most estimable characters.</p>
<p>However, the pages must speak for themselves.&nbsp; Some few
readers, I trust&mdash;to take a serious view&mdash;will be
reminded by this imperfect story, in a manner not unprofitable to
the growth of the social sympathies, of the pathos, misery,
long-suffering, and divine tenderness which in real life
frequently accompany the passion of such a woman as Viviette for
a lover several years her junior.</p>
<p>The scene of the action was suggested by two real spots in the
part of the country specified, each of which has a column
standing upon it.&nbsp; Certain surrounding peculiarities have
been imported into the narrative from both sites.</p>

<h2>TWO ON A TOWER.</h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>On an early winter afternoon, clear but not cold, when the
vegetable world was a weird multitude of skeletons through whose
ribs the sun shone freely, a gleaming landau came to a pause on
the crest of a hill in Wessex.&nbsp; The spot was where the old
Melchester Road, which the carriage had hitherto followed, was
joined by a drive that led round into a park at no great distance
off.</p>
<p>The footman alighted, and went to the occupant of the
carriage, a lady about eight- or nine-and-twenty.&nbsp; She was
looking through the opening afforded by a field-gate at the
undulating stretch of country beyond.&nbsp; In pursuance of some
remark from her the servant looked in the same direction.</p>
<p>The central feature of the middle distance, as they beheld it,
was a circular isolated hill, of no great elevation, which placed
itself in strong chromatic contrast with a wide acreage of
surrounding arable by being covered with fir-trees.&nbsp; The
trees were all of one size and age, so that their tips assumed
the precise curve of the hill they grew upon.&nbsp; This
pine-clad protuberance was yet further marked out from the
general landscape by having on its summit a tower in the form of
a classical column, which, though partly immersed in the
plantation, rose above the tree-tops to a considerable
height.&nbsp; Upon this object the eyes of lady and servant were
bent.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then there is no road leading near it?&rsquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing nearer than where we are now, my
lady.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then drive home,&rsquo; she said after a moment.&nbsp;
And the carriage rolled on its way.</p>
<p>A few days later, the same lady, in the same carriage, passed
that spot again.&nbsp; Her eyes, as before, turned to the distant
tower.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nobbs,&rsquo; she said to the coachman, &lsquo;could
you find your way home through that field, so as to get near the
outskirts of the plantation where the column is?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The coachman regarded the field.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, my
lady,&rsquo; he observed, &lsquo;in dry weather we might drive in
there by inching and pinching, and so get across by
Five-and-Twenty Acres, all being well.&nbsp; But the ground is so
heavy after these rains that perhaps it would hardly be safe to
try it now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps not,&rsquo; she assented indifferently.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Remember it, will you, at a drier time?&rsquo;</p>
<p>And again the carriage sped along the road, the lady&rsquo;s
eyes resting on the segmental hill, the blue trees that muffled
it, and the column that formed its apex, till they were out of
sight.</p>
<p>A long time elapsed before that lady drove over the hill
again.&nbsp; It was February; the soil was now unquestionably
dry, the weather and scene being in other respects much as they
had been before.&nbsp; The familiar shape of the column seemed to
remind her that at last an opportunity for a close inspection had
arrived.&nbsp; Giving her directions she saw the gate opened, and
after a little manoeuvring the carriage swayed slowly into the
uneven field.</p>
<p>Although the pillar stood upon the hereditary estate of her
husband the lady had never visited it, owing to its insulation by
this well-nigh impracticable ground.&nbsp; The drive to the base
of the hill was tedious and jerky, and on reaching it she
alighted, directing that the carriage should be driven back empty
over the clods, to wait for her on the nearest edge of the
field.&nbsp; She then ascended beneath the trees on foot.</p>
<p>The column now showed itself as a much more important erection
than it had appeared from the road, or the park, or the windows
of Welland House, her residence hard by, whence she had surveyed
it hundreds of times without ever feeling a sufficient interest
in its details to investigate them.&nbsp; The column had been
erected in the last century, as a substantial memorial of her
husband&rsquo;s great-grandfather, a respectable officer who had
fallen in the American war, and the reason of her lack of
interest was partly owing to her relations with this husband, of
which more anon.&nbsp; It was little beyond the sheer desire for
something to do&mdash;the chronic desire of her curiously lonely
life&mdash;that had brought her here now.&nbsp; She was in a mood
to welcome anything that would in some measure disperse an almost
killing <i>ennui</i>.&nbsp; She would have welcomed even a
misfortune.&nbsp; She had heard that from the summit of the
pillar four counties could be seen.&nbsp; Whatever pleasurable
effect was to be derived from looking into four counties she
resolved to enjoy to-day.</p>
<p>The fir-shrouded hill-top was (according to some antiquaries)
an old Roman camp,&mdash;if it were not (as others insisted) an
old British castle, or (as the rest swore) an old Saxon field of
Witenagemote,&mdash;with remains of an outer and an inner vallum,
a winding path leading up between their overlapping ends by an
easy ascent.&nbsp; The spikelets from the trees formed a soft
carpet over the route, and occasionally a brake of brambles
barred the interspaces of the trunks.&nbsp; Soon she stood
immediately at the foot of the column.</p>
<p>It had been built in the Tuscan order of classic architecture,
and was really a tower, being hollow with steps inside.&nbsp; The
gloom and solitude which prevailed round the base were
remarkable.&nbsp; The sob of the environing trees was here
expressively manifest; and moved by the light breeze their thin
straight stems rocked in seconds, like inverted pendulums; while
some boughs and twigs rubbed the pillar&rsquo;s sides, or
occasionally clicked in catching each other.&nbsp; Below the
level of their summits the masonry was lichen-stained and
mildewed, for the sun never pierced that moaning cloud of
blue-black vegetation.&nbsp; Pads of moss grew in the joints of
the stone-work, and here and there shade-loving insects had
engraved on the mortar patterns of no human style or meaning; but
curious and suggestive.&nbsp; Above the trees the case was
different: the pillar rose into the sky a bright and cheerful
thing, unimpeded, clean, and flushed with the sunlight.</p>
<p>The spot was seldom visited by a pedestrian, except perhaps in
the shooting season.&nbsp; The rarity of human intrusion was
evidenced by the mazes of rabbit-runs, the feathers of shy birds,
the exuvi&aelig; of reptiles; as also by the well-worn paths of
squirrels down the sides of trunks, and thence horizontally
away.&nbsp; The fact of the plantation being an island in the
midst of an arable plain sufficiently accounted for this lack of
visitors.&nbsp; Few unaccustomed to such places can be aware of
the insulating effect of ploughed ground, when no necessity
compels people to traverse it.&nbsp; This rotund hill of trees
and brambles, standing in the centre of a ploughed field of some
ninety or a hundred acres, was probably visited less frequently
than a rock would have been visited in a lake of equal
extent.</p>
<p>She walked round the column to the other side, where she found
the door through which the interior was reached.&nbsp; The paint,
if it had ever had any, was all washed from the wood, and down
the decaying surface of the boards liquid rust from the nails and
hinges had run in red stains.&nbsp; Over the door was a stone
tablet, bearing, apparently, letters or words; but the
inscription, whatever it was, had been smoothed over with a
plaster of lichen.</p>
<p>Here stood this aspiring piece of masonry, erected as the most
conspicuous and ineffaceable reminder of a man that could be
thought of; and yet the whole aspect of the memorial betokened
forgetfulness.&nbsp; Probably not a dozen people within the
district knew the name of the person commemorated, while perhaps
not a soul remembered whether the column were hollow or solid,
whether with or without a tablet explaining its date and
purpose.&nbsp; She herself had lived within a mile of it for the
last five years, and had never come near it till now.</p>
<p>She hesitated to ascend alone, but finding that the door was
not fastened she pushed it open with her foot, and entered.&nbsp;
A scrap of writing-paper lay within, and arrested her attention
by its freshness.&nbsp; Some human being, then, knew the spot,
despite her surmises.&nbsp; But as the paper had nothing on it no
clue was afforded; yet feeling herself the proprietor of the
column and of all around it her self-assertiveness was sufficient
to lead her on.&nbsp; The staircase was lighted by slits in the
wall, and there was no difficulty in reaching the top, the steps
being quite unworn.&nbsp; The trap-door leading on to the roof
was open, and on looking through it an interesting spectacle met
her eye.</p>
<p>A youth was sitting on a stool in the centre of the lead flat
which formed the summit of the column, his eye being applied to
the end of a large telescope that stood before him on a
tripod.&nbsp; This sort of presence was unexpected, and the lady
started back into the shade of the opening.&nbsp; The only effect
produced upon him by her footfall was an impatient wave of the
hand, which he did without removing his eye from the instrument,
as if to forbid her to interrupt him.</p>
<p>Pausing where she stood the lady examined the aspect of the
individual who thus made himself so completely at home on a
building which she deemed her unquestioned property.&nbsp; He was
a youth who might properly have been characterized by a word the
judicious chronicler would not readily use in such a connexion,
preferring to reserve it for raising images of the opposite
sex.&nbsp; Whether because no deep felicity is likely to arise
from the condition, or from any other reason, to say in these
days that a youth is beautiful is not to award him that amount of
credit which the expression would have carried with it if he had
lived in the times of the Classical Dictionary.&nbsp; So much,
indeed, is the reverse the case that the assertion creates an
awkwardness in saying anything more about him.&nbsp; The
beautiful youth usually verges so perilously on the incipient
coxcomb, who is about to become the Lothario or Juan among the
neighbouring maidens, that, for the due understanding of our
present young man, his sublime innocence of any thought
concerning his own material aspect, or that of others, is most
fervently asserted, and must be as fervently believed.</p>
<p>Such as he was, there the lad sat.&nbsp; The sun shone full in
his face, and on his head he wore a black velvet skull-cap,
leaving to view below it a curly margin of very light shining
hair, which accorded well with the flush upon his cheek.</p>
<p>He had such a complexion as that with which Raffaelle enriches
the countenance of the youthful son of Zacharias,&mdash;a
complexion which, though clear, is far enough removed from virgin
delicacy, and suggests plenty of sun and wind as its
accompaniment.&nbsp; His features were sufficiently straight in
the contours to correct the beholder&rsquo;s first impression
that the head was the head of a girl.&nbsp; Beside him stood a
little oak table, and in front was the telescope.</p>
<p>His visitor had ample time to make these observations; and she
may have done so all the more keenly through being herself of a
totally opposite type.&nbsp; Her hair was black as midnight, her
eyes had no less deep a shade, and her complexion showed the
richness demanded as a support to these decided features.&nbsp;
As she continued to look at the pretty fellow before her,
apparently so far abstracted into some speculative world as
scarcely to know a real one, a warmer wave of her warm
temperament glowed visibly through her, and a qualified observer
might from this have hazarded a guess that there was Romance
blood in her veins.</p>
<p>But even the interest attaching to the youth could not arrest
her attention for ever, and as he made no further signs of moving
his eye from the instrument she broke the silence with&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you see?&mdash;something happening
somewhere?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, quite a catastrophe!&rsquo; he automatically
murmured, without moving round.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A cyclone in the sun.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The lady paused, as if to consider the weight of that event in
the scale of terrene life.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will it make any difference to us here?&rsquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>The young man by this time seemed to be awakened to the
consciousness that somebody unusual was talking to him; he
turned, and started.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
thought it was my relative come to look after me!&nbsp; She often
comes about this time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He continued to look at her and forget the sun, just such a
reciprocity of influence as might have been expected between a
dark lady and a flaxen-haired youth making itself apparent in the
faces of each.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let me interrupt your observations,&rsquo;
said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, no,&rsquo; said he, again applying his eye;
whereupon his face lost the animation which her presence had lent
it, and became immutable as that of a bust, though superadding to
the serenity of repose the sensitiveness of life.&nbsp; The
expression that settled on him was one of awe.&nbsp; Not unaptly
might it have been said that he was worshipping the sun.&nbsp;
Among the various intensities of that worship which have
prevailed since the first intelligent being saw the luminary
decline westward, as the young man now beheld it doing, his was
not the weakest.&nbsp; He was engaged in what may be called a
very chastened or schooled form of that first and most natural of
adorations.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But would you like to see it?&rsquo; he
recommenced.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is an event that is witnessed only
about once in two or three years, though it may occur often
enough.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She assented, and looked through the shaded eyepiece, and saw
a whirling mass, in the centre of which the blazing globe seemed
to be laid bare to its core.&nbsp; It was a peep into a maelstrom
of fire, taking place where nobody had ever been or ever would
be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is the strangest thing I ever beheld,&rsquo; she
said.&nbsp; Then he looked again; till wondering who her
companion could be she asked, &lsquo;Are you often
here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Every night when it is not cloudy, and often in the
day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, night, of course.&nbsp; The heavens must be
beautiful from this point.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They are rather more than that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed!&nbsp; Have you entirely taken possession of
this column?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Entirely.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But it is my column,&rsquo; she said, with smiling
asperity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then are you Lady Constantine, wife of the absent Sir
Blount Constantine?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am Lady Constantine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, then I agree that it is your
ladyship&rsquo;s.&nbsp; But will you allow me to rent it of you
for a time, Lady Constantine?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have taken it, whether I allow it or not.&nbsp;
However, in the interests of science it is advisable that you
continue your tenancy.&nbsp; Nobody knows you are here, I
suppose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hardly anybody.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He then took her down a few steps into the interior, and
showed her some ingenious contrivances for stowing articles
away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nobody ever comes near the column,&mdash;or, as
it&rsquo;s called here, Rings-Hill Speer,&rsquo; he continued;
&lsquo;and when I first came up it nobody had been here for
thirty or forty years.&nbsp; The staircase was choked with
daws&rsquo; nests and feathers, but I cleared them
out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I understood the column was always kept
locked?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, it has been so.&nbsp; When it was built, in 1782,
the key was given to my great-grandfather, to keep by him in case
visitors should happen to want it.&nbsp; He lived just down there
where I live now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He denoted by a nod a little dell lying immediately beyond the
ploughed land which environed them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He kept it in his bureau, and as the bureau descended
to my grandfather, my mother, and myself, the key descended with
it.&nbsp; After the first thirty or forty years, nobody ever
asked for it.&nbsp; One day I saw it, lying rusty in its niche,
and, finding that it belonged to this column, I took it and came
up.&nbsp; I stayed here till it was dark, and the stars came out,
and that night I resolved to be an astronomer.&nbsp; I came back
here from school several months ago, and I mean to be an
astronomer still.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He lowered his voice, and added:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I aim at nothing less than the dignity and office of
Astronomer Royal, if I live.&nbsp; Perhaps I shall not
live.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see why you should suppose that,&rsquo;
said she.&nbsp; &lsquo;How long are you going to make this your
observatory?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;About a year longer&mdash;till I have obtained a
practical familiarity with the heavens.&nbsp; Ah, if I only had a
good equatorial!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A proper instrument for my pursuit.&nbsp; But time is
short, and science is infinite,&mdash;how infinite only those who
study astronomy fully realize,&mdash;and perhaps I shall be worn
out before I make my mark.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She seemed to be greatly struck by the odd mixture in him of
scientific earnestness and melancholy mistrust of all things
human.&nbsp; Perhaps it was owing to the nature of his
studies.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are often on this tower alone at night?&rsquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; at this time of the year particularly, and while
there is no moon.&nbsp; I observe from seven or eight till about
two in the morning, with a view to my great work on variable
stars.&nbsp; But with such a telescope as this&mdash;well, I must
put up with it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can you see Saturn&rsquo;s ring and Jupiter&rsquo;s
moons?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He said drily that he could manage to do that, not without
some contempt for the state of her knowledge.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have never seen any planet or star through a
telescope.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you will come the first clear night, Lady
Constantine, I will show you any number.&nbsp; I mean, at your
express wish; not otherwise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should like to come, and possibly may at some
time.&nbsp; These stars that vary so much&mdash;sometimes evening
stars, sometimes morning stars, sometimes in the east, and
sometimes in the west&mdash;have always interested me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah&mdash;now there is a reason for your not
coming.&nbsp; Your ignorance of the realities of astronomy is so
satisfactory that I will not disturb it except at your serious
request.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I wish to be enlightened.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me caution you against it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is enlightenment on the subject, then, so
terrible?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, indeed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She laughingly declared that nothing could have so piqued her
curiosity as his statement, and turned to descend.&nbsp; He
helped her down the stairs and through the briers.&nbsp; He would
have gone further and crossed the open corn-land with her, but
she preferred to go alone.&nbsp; He then retraced his way to the
top of the column, but, instead of looking longer at the sun,
watched her diminishing towards the distant fence, behind which
waited the carriage.&nbsp; When in the midst of the field, a dark
spot on an area of brown, there crossed her path a moving figure,
whom it was as difficult to distinguish from the earth he trod as
the caterpillar from its leaf, by reason of the excellent match
between his clothes and the clods.&nbsp; He was one of a
dying-out generation who retained the principle, nearly unlearnt
now, that a man&rsquo;s habiliments should be in harmony with his
environment.&nbsp; Lady Constantine and this figure halted beside
each other for some minutes; then they went on their several
ways.</p>
<p>The brown person was a labouring man known to the world of
Welland as Haymoss (the encrusted form of the word Amos, to adopt
the phrase of philologists).&nbsp; The reason of the halt had
been some inquiries addressed to him by Lady Constantine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who is that&mdash;Amos Fry, I think?&rsquo; she had
asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes my lady,&rsquo; said Haymoss; &lsquo;a homely
barley driller, born under the eaves of your ladyship&rsquo;s
outbuildings, in a manner of speaking,&mdash;though your ladyship
was neither born nor &lsquo;tempted at that time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who lives in the old house behind the
plantation?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Old Gammer Martin, my lady, and her
grandson.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He has neither father nor mother, then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not a single one, my lady.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where was he educated?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;At Warborne,&mdash;a place where they draw up young
gam&rsquo;sters&rsquo; brains like rhubarb under a ninepenny pan,
my lady, excusing my common way.&nbsp; They hit so much larning
into en that &rsquo;a could talk like the day of Pentecost; which
is a wonderful thing for a simple boy, and his mother only the
plainest ciphering woman in the world.&nbsp; Warborne Grammar
School&mdash;that&rsquo;s where &rsquo;twas &rsquo;a went
to.&nbsp; His father, the reverent Pa&rsquo;son St. Cleeve, made
a terrible bruckle hit in &rsquo;s marrying, in the sight of the
high.&nbsp; He were the curate here, my lady, for a length
o&rsquo; time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, curate,&rsquo; said Lady Constantine.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It was before I knew the village.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, long and merry ago!&nbsp; And he married Farmer
Martin&rsquo;s daughter&mdash;Giles Martin, a limberish man, who
used to go rather bad upon his lags, if you can mind.&nbsp; I
knowed the man well enough; who should know en better!&nbsp; The
maid was a poor windling thing, and, though a playward piece
o&rsquo; flesh when he married her, &rsquo;a socked and sighed,
and went out like a snoff!&nbsp; Yes, my lady.&nbsp; Well, when
Pa&rsquo;son St. Cleeve married this homespun woman the
toppermost folk wouldn&rsquo;t speak to his wife.&nbsp; Then he
dropped a cuss or two, and said he&rsquo;d no longer get his
living by curing their twopenny souls o&rsquo; such d--- nonsense
as that (excusing my common way), and he took to farming
straightway, and then &rsquo;a dropped down dead in a
nor&rsquo;-west thunderstorm; it being
said&mdash;hee-hee!&mdash;that Master God was in tantrums
wi&rsquo;en for leaving his service,&mdash;hee-hee!&nbsp; I give
the story as I heard it, my lady, but be dazed if I believe in
such trumpery about folks in the sky, nor anything else
that&rsquo;s said on &rsquo;em, good or bad.&nbsp; Well, Swithin,
the boy, was sent to the grammar school, as I say for; but what
with having two stations of life in his blood he&rsquo;s good for
nothing, my lady.&nbsp; He mopes about&mdash;sometimes here, and
sometimes there; nobody troubles about en.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lady Constantine thanked her informant, and proceeded
onward.&nbsp; To her, as a woman, the most curious feature in the
afternoon&rsquo;s incident was that this lad, of striking beauty,
scientific attainments, and cultivated bearing, should be linked,
on the maternal side, with a local agricultural family through
his father&rsquo;s matrimonial eccentricity.&nbsp; A more
attractive feature in the case was that the same youth, so
capable of being ruined by flattery, blandishment, pleasure, even
gross prosperity, should be at present living on in a primitive
Eden of unconsciousness, with aims towards whose accomplishment a
Caliban shape would have been as effective as his own.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>Swithin St. Cleeve lingered on at his post, until the more
sanguine birds of the plantation, already recovering from their
midwinter anxieties, piped a short evening hymn to the vanishing
sun.</p>
<p>The landscape was gently concave; with the exception of tower
and hill there were no points on which late rays might linger;
and hence the dish-shaped ninety acres of tilled land assumed a
uniform hue of shade quite suddenly.&nbsp; The one or two stars
that appeared were quickly clouded over, and it was soon obvious
that there would be no sweeping the heavens that night.&nbsp;
After tying a piece of tarpaulin, which had once seen service on
his maternal grandfather&rsquo;s farm, over all the apparatus
around him, he went down the stairs in the dark, and locked the
door.</p>
<p>With the key in his pocket he descended through the underwood
on the side of the slope opposite to that trodden by Lady
Constantine, and crossed the field in a line mathematically
straight, and in a manner that left no traces, by keeping in the
same furrow all the way on tiptoe.&nbsp; In a few minutes he
reached a little dell, which occurred quite unexpectedly on the
other side of the field-fence, and descended to a venerable
thatched house, whose enormous roof, broken up by dormers as big
as haycocks, could be seen even in the twilight.&nbsp; Over the
white walls, built of chalk in the lump, outlines of creepers
formed dark patterns, as if drawn in charcoal.</p>
<p>Inside the house his maternal grandmother was sitting by a
wood fire.&nbsp; Before it stood a pipkin, in which something was
evidently kept warm.&nbsp; An eight-legged oak table in the
middle of the room was laid for a meal.&nbsp; This woman of
eighty, in a large mob cap, under which she wore a little cap to
keep the other clean, retained faculties but little
blunted.&nbsp; She was gazing into the flames, with her hands
upon her knees, quietly re-enacting in her brain certain of the
long chain of episodes, pathetic, tragical, and humorous, which
had constituted the parish history for the last sixty
years.&nbsp; On Swithin&rsquo;s entry she looked up at him in a
sideway direction.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You should not have waited for me, granny,&rsquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis of no account, my child.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
had a nap while sitting here.&nbsp; Yes, I&rsquo;ve had a nap,
and went straight up into my old country again, as usual.&nbsp;
The place was as natural as when I left it,&mdash;e&rsquo;en just
threescore years ago!&nbsp; All the folks and my old aunt were
there, as when I was a child,&mdash;yet I suppose if I were
really to set out and go there, hardly a soul would be left alive
to say to me, dog how art!&nbsp; But tell Hannah to stir her
stumps and serve supper&mdash;though I&rsquo;d fain do it myself,
the poor old soul is getting so unhandy!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Hannah revealed herself to be much nimbler and several years
younger than granny, though of this the latter seemed to be
oblivious.&nbsp; When the meal was nearly over Mrs. Martin
produced the contents of the mysterious vessel by the fire,
saying that she had caused it to be brought in from the back
kitchen, because Hannah was hardly to be trusted with such
things, she was becoming so childish.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is it, then?&rsquo; said Swithin.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh,
one of your special puddings.&rsquo;&nbsp; At sight of it,
however, he added reproachfully, &lsquo;Now, granny!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Instead of being round, it was in shape an irregular boulder
that had been exposed to the weather for centuries&mdash;a little
scrap pared off here, and a little piece broken away there; the
general aim being, nevertheless, to avoid destroying the symmetry
of the pudding while taking as much as possible of its
substance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The fact is,&rsquo; added Swithin, &lsquo;the pudding
is half gone!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve only sliced off the merest paring once or
twice, to taste if it was well done!&rsquo; pleaded granny
Martin, with wounded feelings.&nbsp; &lsquo;I said to Hannah when
she took it up, &ldquo;Put it here to keep it warm, as
there&rsquo;s a better fire than in the back
kitchen.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I am not going to eat any of it!&rsquo; said
Swithin decisively, as he rose from the table, pushed away his
chair, and went up-stairs; the &lsquo;other station of life that
was in his blood,&rsquo; and which had been brought out by the
grammar school, probably stimulating him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, the world is an ungrateful place!&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas
a pity I didn&rsquo;t take my poor name off this earthly calendar
and creep under ground sixty long years ago, instead of leaving
my own county to come here!&rsquo; mourned old Mrs. Martin.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But I told his mother how &rsquo;twould be&mdash;marrying
so many notches above her.&nbsp; The child was sure to chaw high,
like his father!&rsquo;</p>
<p>When Swithin had been up-stairs a minute or two however, he
altered his mind, and coming down again ate all the pudding, with
the aspect of a person undertaking a deed of great
magnanimity.&nbsp; The relish with which he did so restored the
unison that knew no more serious interruptions than such as
this.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Torkingham has been here this afternoon,&rsquo;
said his grandmother; &lsquo;and he wants me to let him meet some
of the choir here to-night for practice.&nbsp; They who live at
this end of the parish won&rsquo;t go to his house to try over
the tunes, because &rsquo;tis so far, they say, and so
&rsquo;tis, poor men.&nbsp; So he&rsquo;s going to see what
coming to them will do.&nbsp; He asks if you would like to
join.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would if I had not so much to do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But it is cloudy to-night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; but I have calculations without end, granny.&nbsp;
Now, don&rsquo;t you tell him I&rsquo;m in the house, will you?
and then he&rsquo;ll not ask for me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But if he should, must I then tell a lie, Lord forgive
me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, you can say I&rsquo;m up-stairs; he must think what
he likes.&nbsp; Not a word about the astronomy to any of them,
whatever you do.&nbsp; I should be called a visionary, and all
sorts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So thou beest, child.&nbsp; Why can&rsquo;t ye do
something that&rsquo;s of use?&rsquo;</p>
<p>At the sound of footsteps Swithin beat a hasty retreat
up-stairs, where he struck a light, and revealed a table covered
with books and papers, while round the walls hung star-maps, and
other diagrams illustrative of celestial phenomena.&nbsp; In a
corner stood a huge pasteboard tube, which a close inspection
would have shown to be intended for a telescope.&nbsp; Swithin
hung a thick cloth over the window, in addition to the curtains,
and sat down to his papers.&nbsp; On the ceiling was a black
stain of smoke, and under this he placed his lamp, evidencing
that the midnight oil was consumed on that precise spot very
often.</p>
<p>Meanwhile there had entered to the room below a personage who,
to judge from her voice and the quick pit-pat of her feet, was a
maiden young and blithe.&nbsp; Mrs. Martin welcomed her by the
title of Miss Tabitha Lark, and inquired what wind had brought
her that way; to which the visitor replied that she had come for
the singing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sit ye down, then,&rsquo; said granny.&nbsp; &lsquo;And
do you still go to the House to read to my lady?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I go and read, Mrs. Martin; but as to getting my
lady to hearken, that&rsquo;s more than a team of six horses
could force her to do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The girl had a remarkably smart and fluent utterance, which
was probably a cause, or a consequence, of her vocation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis the same story, then?&rsquo; said
grandmother Martin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; Eaten out with listlessness.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s neither sick nor sorry, but how dull and dreary she
is, only herself can tell.&nbsp; When I get there in the morning,
there she is sitting up in bed, for my lady don&rsquo;t care to
get up; and then she makes me bring this book and that book, till
the bed is heaped up with immense volumes that half bury her,
making her look, as she leans upon her elbow, like the stoning of
Stephen.&nbsp; She yawns; then she looks towards the tall glass;
then she looks out at the weather, mooning her great black eyes,
and fixing them on the sky as if they stuck there, while my
tongue goes flick-flack along, a hundred and fifty words a
minute; then she looks at the clock; then she asks me what
I&rsquo;ve been reading.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, poor soul!&rsquo; said granny.&nbsp; &lsquo;No
doubt she says in the morning, &ldquo;Would God it were
evening,&rdquo; and in the evening, &ldquo;Would God it were
morning,&rdquo; like the disobedient woman in
Deuteronomy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Swithin, in the room overhead, had suspended his calculations,
for the duologue interested him.&nbsp; There now crunched heavier
steps outside the door, and his grandmother could be heard
greeting sundry local representatives of the bass and tenor
voice, who lent a cheerful and well-known personality to the
names Sammy Blore, Nat Chapman, Hezekiah Biles, and Haymoss Fry
(the latter being one with whom the reader has already a distant
acquaintance); besides these came small producers of treble, who
had not yet developed into such distinctive units of society as
to require particularizing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is the good man come?&rsquo; asked Nat Chapman.&nbsp;
&lsquo;No,&mdash;I see we be here afore him.&nbsp; And how is it
with aged women to-night, Mrs. Martin?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tedious traipsing enough with this one, Nat.&nbsp; Sit
ye down.&nbsp; Well, little Freddy, you don&rsquo;t wish in the
morning that &rsquo;twere evening, and at evening that
&rsquo;twere morning again, do you, Freddy, trust ye for
it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, who might wish such a thing as that, Mrs
Martin?&mdash;nobody in this parish?&rsquo; asked Sammy Blore
curiously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My lady is always wishing it,&rsquo; spoke up Miss
Tabitha Lark.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, she!&nbsp; Nobody can be answerable for the wishes
of that onnatural tribe of mankind.&nbsp; Not but that the
woman&rsquo;s heart-strings is tried in many aggravating
ways.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, poor woman!&rsquo; said granny.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
state she finds herself in&mdash;neither maid, wife, nor widow,
as you may say&mdash;is not the primest form of life for keeping
in good spirits.&nbsp; How long is it since she has heard from
Sir Blount, Tabitha?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Two years and more,&rsquo; said the young woman.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He went into one side of Africa, as it might be, three St.
Martin&rsquo;s days back.&nbsp; I can mind it, because
&rsquo;twas my birthday.&nbsp; And he meant to come out the other
side.&nbsp; But he didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; He has never come out at
all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For all the world like losing a rat in a
barley-mow,&rsquo; said Hezekiah.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;s lost,
though you know where he is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>His comrades nodded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, my lady is a walking weariness.&nbsp; I seed her
yawn just at the very moment when the fox was halloaed away by
Lornton Copse, and the hounds runned en all but past her carriage
wheels.&nbsp; If I were she I&rsquo;d see a little life; though
there&rsquo;s no fair, club-walking, nor feast to speak of, till
Easter week,&mdash;that&rsquo;s true.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She dares not.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s under solemn oath to
do no such thing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Be cust if I would keep any such oath!&nbsp; But
here&rsquo;s the pa&rsquo;son, if my ears don&rsquo;t deceive
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was a noise of horse&rsquo;s hoofs without, a stumbling
against the door-scraper, a tethering to the window-shutter, a
creaking of the door on its hinges, and a voice which Swithin
recognized as Mr. Torkingham&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He greeted each of
the previous arrivals by name, and stated that he was glad to see
them all so punctually assembled.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, sir,&rsquo; said Haymoss Fry.&nbsp;
&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis only my jints that have kept me from assembling
myself long ago.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d assemble upon the top of Welland
Steeple, if &rsquo;tweren&rsquo;t for my jints.&nbsp; I assure
ye, Pa&rsquo;son Tarkenham, that in the clitch o&rsquo; my knees,
where the rain used to come through when I was cutting clots for
the new lawn, in old my lady&rsquo;s time, &rsquo;tis as if rats
wez gnawing, every now and then.&nbsp; When a feller&rsquo;s
young he&rsquo;s too small in the brain to see how soon a
constitution can be squandered, worse luck!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;True,&rsquo; said Biles, to fill the time while the
parson was engaged in finding the Psalms.&nbsp; &lsquo;A
man&rsquo;s a fool till he&rsquo;s forty.&nbsp; Often have I
thought, when hay-pitching, and the small of my back seeming no
stouter than a harnet&rsquo;s, &ldquo;The devil send that I had
but the making of labouring men for a twelvemonth!&rdquo;&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d gie every man jack two good backbones, even if the
alteration was as wrong as forgery.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Four,&mdash;four backbones,&rsquo; said Haymoss,
decisively.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, four,&rsquo; threw in Sammy Blore, with additional
weight of experience.&nbsp; &lsquo;For you want one in front for
breast-ploughing and such like, one at the right side for
ground-dressing, and one at the left side for turning
mixens.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well; then next I&rsquo;d move every man&rsquo;s
wyndpipe a good span away from his glutchpipe, so that at harvest
time he could fetch breath in &rsquo;s drinking, without being
choked and strangled as he is now.&nbsp; Thinks I, when I feel
the victuals going&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, we&rsquo;ll begin,&rsquo; interrupted Mr.
Torkingham, his mind returning to this world again on concluding
his search for a hymn.</p>
<p>Thereupon the racket of chair-legs on the floor signified that
they were settling into their seats,&mdash;a disturbance which
Swithin took advantage of by going on tiptoe across the floor
above, and putting sheets of paper over knot-holes in the
boarding at points where carpet was lacking, that his lamp-light
might not shine down.&nbsp; The absence of a ceiling beneath
rendered his position virtually that of one suspended in the same
apartment.</p>
<p>The parson announced the tune, and his voice burst forth with
&lsquo;Onward, Christian soldiers!&rsquo; in notes of rigid
cheerfulness.</p>
<p>In this start, however, he was joined only by the girls and
boys, the men furnishing but an accompaniment of ahas and
hems.&nbsp; Mr. Torkingham stopped, and Sammy Blore
spoke,&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Beg your pardon, sir,&mdash;if you&rsquo;ll deal mild
with us a moment.&nbsp; What with the wind and walking, my
throat&rsquo;s as rough as a grater; and not knowing you were
going to hit up that minute, I hadn&rsquo;t hawked, and I
don&rsquo;t think Hezzy and Nat had, either,&mdash;had ye,
souls?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hadn&rsquo;t got thorough ready, that&rsquo;s
true,&rsquo; said Hezekiah.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite right of you, then, to speak,&rsquo; said Mr.
Torkingham.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t mind explaining; we are here
for practice.&nbsp; Now clear your throats, then, and at it
again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was a noise as of atmospheric hoes and scrapers, and the
bass contingent at last got under way with a time of its own:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Honwerd, Christen sojers!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s where we are so defective&mdash;the
pronunciation,&rsquo; interrupted the parson.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now
repeat after me: &ldquo;On-ward, Christ-ian,
sol-diers.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>The choir repeated like an exaggerative echo: &lsquo;On-wed,
Chris-ting, sol-jaws!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Better!&rsquo; said the parson, in the strenuously
sanguine tones of a man who got his living by discovering a
bright side in things where it was not very perceptible to other
people.&nbsp; &lsquo;But it should not be given with quite so
extreme an accent; or we may be called affected by other
parishes.&nbsp; And, Nathaniel Chapman, there&rsquo;s a
jauntiness in your manner of singing which is not quite
becoming.&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t you sing more
earnestly?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My conscience won&rsquo;t let me, sir.&nbsp; They say
every man for himself: but, thank God, I&rsquo;m not so mean as
to lessen old fokes&rsquo; chances by being earnest at my time
o&rsquo; life, and they so much nearer the need
o&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s bad reasoning, Nat, I fear.&nbsp; Now,
perhaps we had better sol-fa the tune.&nbsp; Eyes on your books,
please.&nbsp; Sol-sol! fa-fa! mi&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t sing like that, not I!&rsquo; said Sammy
Blore, with condemnatory astonishment.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can sing
genuine music, like F and G; but not anything so much out of the
order of nater as that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;ve brought the wrong book,
sir?&rsquo; chimed in Haymoss, kindly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve
knowed music early in life and late,&mdash;in short, ever since
Luke Sneap broke his new fiddle-bow in the wedding psalm, when
Pa&rsquo;son Wilton brought home his bride (you can mind the
time, Sammy?&mdash;when we sung &ldquo;His wife, like a fair
fertile vine, her lovely fruit shall bring,&rdquo; when the young
woman turned as red as a rose, not knowing &rsquo;twas
coming).&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve knowed music ever since then, I say,
sir, and never heard the like o&rsquo; that.&nbsp; Every martel
note had his name of A, B, C, at that time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes, men; but this is a more recent
system!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Still, you can&rsquo;t alter a old-established note
that&rsquo;s A or B by nater,&rsquo; rejoined Haymoss, with yet
deeper conviction that Mr. Torkingham was getting off his
head.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now sound A, neighbour Sammy, and let&rsquo;s
have a slap at Christen sojers again, and show the Pa&rsquo;son
the true way!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Sammy produced a private tuning-fork, black and grimy, which,
being about seventy years of age, and wrought before pianoforte
builders had sent up the pitch to make their instruments
brilliant, was nearly a note flatter than the
parson&rsquo;s.&nbsp; While an argument as to the true pitch was
in progress, there came a knocking without.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Somebody&rsquo;s at the door!&rsquo; said a little
treble girl.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thought I heard a knock before!&rsquo; said the
relieved choir.</p>
<p>The latch was lifted, and a man asked from the darkness,
&lsquo;Is Mr. Torkingham here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Mills.&nbsp; What do you want?&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was the parson&rsquo;s man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, if you please,&rsquo; said Mills, showing an
advanced margin of himself round the door, &lsquo;Lady
Constantine wants to see you very particular, sir, and could you
call on her after dinner, if you ben&rsquo;t engaged with poor
fokes?&nbsp; She&rsquo;s just had a letter,&mdash;so they
say,&mdash;and it&rsquo;s about that, I believe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Finding, on looking at his watch, that it was necessary to
start at once if he meant to see her that night, the parson cut
short the practising, and, naming another night for meeting, he
withdrew.&nbsp; All the singers assisted him on to his cob, and
watched him till he disappeared over the edge of the Bottom.</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>Mr. Torkingham trotted briskly onward to his house, a distance
of about a mile, each cottage, as it revealed its half-buried
position by its single light, appearing like a one-eyed night
creature watching him from an ambush.&nbsp; Leaving his horse at
the parsonage he performed the remainder of the journey on foot,
crossing the park towards Welland House by a stile and path, till
he struck into the drive near the north door of the mansion.</p>
<p>This drive, it may be remarked, was also the common highway to
the lower village, and hence Lady Constantine&rsquo;s residence
and park, as is occasionally the case with old-fashioned manors,
possessed none of the exclusiveness found in some aristocratic
settlements.&nbsp; The parishioners looked upon the park avenue
as their natural thoroughfare, particularly for christenings,
weddings, and funerals, which passed the squire&rsquo;s mansion
with due considerations as to the scenic effect of the same from
the manor windows.&nbsp; Hence the house of Constantine, when
going out from its breakfast, had been continually crossed on the
doorstep for the last two hundred years by the houses of Hodge
and Giles in full cry to dinner.&nbsp; At present these
collisions were but too infrequent, for though the villagers
passed the north front door as regularly as ever, they seldom met
a Constantine.&nbsp; Only one was there to be met, and she had no
zest for outings before noon.</p>
<p>The long, low front of the Great House, as it was called by
the parish, stretching from end to end of the terrace, was in
darkness as the vicar slackened his pace before it, and only the
distant fall of water disturbed the stillness of the manorial
precincts.</p>
<p>On gaining admittance he found Lady Constantine waiting to
receive him.&nbsp; She wore a heavy dress of velvet and lace, and
being the only person in the spacious apartment she looked small
and isolated.&nbsp; In her left hand she held a letter and a
couple of at-home cards.&nbsp; The soft dark eyes which she
raised to him as he entered&mdash;large, and melancholy by
circumstance far more than by quality&mdash;were the natural
indices of a warm and affectionate, perhaps slightly voluptuous
temperament, languishing for want of something to do, cherish, or
suffer for.</p>
<p>Mr. Torkingham seated himself.&nbsp; His boots, which had
seemed elegant in the farm-house, appeared rather clumsy here,
and his coat, that was a model of tailoring when he stood amid
the choir, now exhibited decidedly strained relations with his
limbs.&nbsp; Three years had passed since his induction to the
living of Welland, but he had never as yet found means to
establish that reciprocity with Lady Constantine which usually
grows up, in the course of time, between parsonage and
manor-house,&mdash;unless, indeed, either side should surprise
the other by showing respectively a weakness for awkward modern
ideas on landownership, or on church formulas, which had not been
the case here.&nbsp; The present meeting, however, seemed likely
to initiate such a reciprocity.</p>
<p>There was an appearance of confidence on Lady
Constantine&rsquo;s face; she said she was so very glad that he
had come, and looking down at the letter in her hand was on the
point of pulling it from its envelope; but she did not.&nbsp;
After a moment she went on more quickly: &lsquo;I wanted your
advice, or rather your opinion, on a serious matter,&mdash;on a
point of conscience.&rsquo;&nbsp; Saying which she laid down the
letter and looked at the cards.</p>
<p>It might have been apparent to a more penetrating eye than the
vicar&rsquo;s that Lady Constantine, either from timidity,
misgiving, or reconviction, had swerved from her intended
communication, or perhaps decided to begin at the other end.</p>
<p>The parson, who had been expecting a question on some local
business or intelligence, at the tenor of her words altered his
face to the higher branch of his profession.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope I may find myself of service, on that or any
other question,&rsquo; he said gently.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope so.&nbsp; You may possibly be aware, Mr.
Torkingham, that my husband, Sir Blount Constantine, was, not to
mince matters, a mistaken&mdash;somewhat jealous man.&nbsp; Yet
you may hardly have discerned it in the short time you knew
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had some little knowledge of Sir Blount&rsquo;s
character in that respect.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, on this account my married life with him was not
of the most comfortable kind.&rsquo;&nbsp; (Lady
Constantine&rsquo;s voice dropped to a more pathetic note.)&nbsp;
&lsquo;I am sure I gave him no cause for suspicion; though had I
known his disposition sooner I should hardly have dared to marry
him.&nbsp; But his jealousy and doubt of me were not so strong as
to divert him from a purpose of his,&mdash;a mania for African
lion-hunting, which he dignified by calling it a scheme of
geographical discovery; for he was inordinately anxious to make a
name for himself in that field.&nbsp; It was the one passion that
was stronger than his mistrust of me.&nbsp; Before going away he
sat down with me in this room, and read me a lecture, which
resulted in a very rash offer on my part.&nbsp; When I tell it to
you, you will find that it provides a key to all that is unusual
in my life here.&nbsp; He bade me consider what my position would
be when he was gone; hoped that I should remember what was due to
him,&mdash;that I would not so behave towards other men as to
bring the name of Constantine into suspicion; and charged me to
avoid levity of conduct in attending any ball, rout, or dinner to
which I might be invited.&nbsp; I, in some contempt for his low
opinion of me, volunteered, there and then, to live like a
cloistered nun during his absence; to go into no society
whatever,&mdash;scarce even to a neighbour&rsquo;s dinner-party;
and demanded bitterly if that would satisfy him.&nbsp; He said
yes, held me to my word, and gave me no loophole for retracting
it.&nbsp; The inevitable fruits of precipitancy have resulted to
me: my life has become a burden.&nbsp; I get such invitations as
these&rsquo; (holding up the cards), &lsquo;but I so invariably
refuse them that they are getting very rare. . . .&nbsp; I ask
you, can I honestly break that promise to my husband?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Torkingham seemed embarrassed.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you
promised Sir Blount Constantine to live in solitude till he comes
back, you are, it seems to me, bound by that promise.&nbsp; I
fear that the wish to be released from your engagement is to some
extent a reason why it should be kept.&nbsp; But your own
conscience would surely be the best guide, Lady
Constantine?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My conscience is quite bewildered with its
responsibilities,&rsquo; she continued, with a sigh.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Yet it certainly does sometimes say to me that&mdash;that
I ought to keep my word.&nbsp; Very well; I must go on as I am
going, I suppose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you respect a vow, I think you must respect your
own,&rsquo; said the parson, acquiring some further
firmness.&nbsp; &lsquo;Had it been wrung from you by compulsion,
moral or physical, it would have been open to you to break
it.&nbsp; But as you proposed a vow when your husband only
required a good intention, I think you ought to adhere to it; or
what is the pride worth that led you to offer it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; she said, with resignation.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But it was quite a work of supererogation on my
part.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That you proposed it in a supererogatory spirit does
not lessen your obligation, having once put yourself under that
obligation.&nbsp; St. Paul, in his Epistle to the Hebrews, says,
&ldquo;An oath for confirmation is an end of all
strife.&rdquo;&nbsp; And you will readily recall the words of
Ecclesiastes, &ldquo;Pay that which thou hast vowed.&nbsp; Better
is it that thou shouldest not vow than that thou shouldest vow
and not pay.&rdquo;&nbsp; Why not write to Sir Blount, tell him
the inconvenience of such a bond, and ask him to release
you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; never will I.&nbsp; The expression of such a desire
would, in his mind, be a sufficient reason for disallowing
it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll keep my word.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Torkingham rose to leave.&nbsp; After she had held out her
hand to him, when he had crossed the room, and was within two
steps of the door, she said, &lsquo;Mr. Torkingham.&rsquo;&nbsp;
He stopped.&nbsp; &lsquo;What I have told you is only the least
part of what I sent for you to tell you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Torkingham walked back to her side.&nbsp; &lsquo;What is
the rest of it, then?&rsquo; he asked, with grave surprise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a true revelation, as far as it goes; but there
is something more.&nbsp; I have received this letter, and I
wanted to say&mdash;something.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then say it now, my dear lady.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; she answered, with a look of utter
inability.&nbsp; &lsquo;I cannot speak of it now!&nbsp; Some
other time.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t stay.&nbsp; Please consider this
conversation as private.&nbsp; Good-night.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>It was a bright starlight night, a week or ten days
later.&nbsp; There had been several such nights since the
occasion of Lady Constantine&rsquo;s promise to Swithin St.
Cleeve to come and study astronomical phenomena on the Rings-Hill
column; but she had not gone there.&nbsp; This evening she sat at
a window, the blind of which had not been drawn down.&nbsp; Her
elbow rested on a little table, and her cheek on her hand.&nbsp;
Her eyes were attracted by the brightness of the planet Jupiter,
as he rode in the ecliptic opposite, beaming down upon her as if
desirous of notice.</p>
<p>Beneath the planet could be still discerned the dark edges of
the park landscape against the sky.&nbsp; As one of its features,
though nearly screened by the trees which had been planted to
shut out the fallow tracts of the estate, rose the upper part of
the column.&nbsp; It was hardly visible now, even if visible at
all; yet Lady Constantine knew from daytime experience its exact
bearing from the window at which she leaned.&nbsp; The knowledge
that there it still was, despite its rapid envelopment by the
shades, led her lonely mind to her late meeting on its summit
with the young astronomer, and to her promise to honour him with
a visit for learning some secrets about the scintillating bodies
overhead.&nbsp; The curious juxtaposition of youthful ardour and
old despair that she had found in the lad would have made him
interesting to a woman of perception, apart from his fair hair
and early-Christian face.&nbsp; But such is the heightening touch
of memory that his beauty was probably richer in her imagination
than in the real.&nbsp; It was a moot point to consider whether
the temptations that would be brought to bear upon him in his
course would exceed the staying power of his nature.&nbsp; Had he
been a wealthy youth he would have seemed one to tremble
for.&nbsp; In spite of his attractive ambitions and gentlemanly
bearing, she thought it would possibly be better for him if he
never became known outside his lonely tower,&mdash;forgetting
that he had received such intellectual enlargement as would
probably make his continuance in Welland seem, in his own eye, a
slight upon his father&rsquo;s branch of his family, whose social
standing had been, only a few years earlier, but little removed
from her own.</p>
<p>Suddenly she flung a cloak about her and went out on the
terrace.&nbsp; She passed down the steps to the lower lawn,
through the door to the open park, and there stood still.&nbsp;
The tower was now discernible.&nbsp; As the words in which a
thought is expressed develop a further thought, so did the fact
of her having got so far influence her to go further.&nbsp; A
person who had casually observed her gait would have thought it
irregular; and the lessenings and increasings of speed with which
she proceeded in the direction of the pillar could be accounted
for only by a motive much more disturbing than an intention to
look through a telescope.&nbsp; Thus she went on, till, leaving
the park, she crossed the turnpike-road, and entered the large
field, in the middle of which the fir-clad hill stood like Mont
St. Michel in its bay.</p>
<p>The stars were so bright as distinctly to show her the place,
and now she could see a faint light at the top of the column,
which rose like a shadowy finger pointing to the upper
constellations.&nbsp; There was no wind, in a human sense; but a
steady stertorous breathing from the fir-trees showed that, now
as always, there was movement in apparent stagnation.&nbsp;
Nothing but an absolute vacuum could paralyze their
utterance.</p>
<p>The door of the tower was shut.&nbsp; It was something more
than the freakishness which is engendered by a sickening monotony
that had led Lady Constantine thus far, and hence she made no ado
about admitting herself.&nbsp; Three years ago, when her every
action was a thing of propriety, she had known of no possible
purpose which could have led her abroad in a manner such as
this.</p>
<p>She ascended the tower noiselessly.&nbsp; On raising her head
above the hatchway she beheld Swithin bending over a scroll of
paper which lay on the little table beside him.&nbsp; The small
lantern that illuminated it showed also that he was warmly
wrapped up in a coat and thick cap, behind him standing the
telescope on its frame.</p>
<p>What was he doing?&nbsp; She looked over his shoulder upon the
paper, and saw figures and signs.&nbsp; When he had jotted down
something he went to the telescope again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What are you doing to-night?&rsquo; she said in a low
voice.</p>
<p>Swithin started, and turned.&nbsp; The faint lamp-light was
sufficient to reveal her face to him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tedious work, Lady Constantine,&rsquo; he answered,
without betraying much surprise.&nbsp; &lsquo;Doing my best to
watch phenomenal stars, as I may call them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You said you would show me the heavens if I could come
on a starlight night.&nbsp; I have come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Swithin, as a preliminary, swept round the telescope to
Jupiter, and exhibited to her the glory of that orb.&nbsp; Then
he directed the instrument to the less bright shape of
Saturn.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here,&rsquo; he said, warming up to the subject,
&lsquo;we see a world which is to my mind by far the most
wonderful in the solar system.&nbsp; Think of streams of
satellites or meteors racing round and round the planet like a
fly-wheel, so close together as to seem solid
matter!&rsquo;&nbsp; He entered further and further into the
subject, his ideas gathering momentum as he went on, like his pet
heavenly bodies.</p>
<p>When he paused for breath she said, in tones very different
from his own, &lsquo;I ought now to tell you that, though I am
interested in the stars, they were not what I came to see you
about. . . .&nbsp; I first thought of disclosing the matter to
Mr. Torkingham; but I altered my mind, and decided on
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She spoke in so low a voice that he might not have heard
her.&nbsp; At all events, abstracted by his grand theme, he did
not heed her.&nbsp; He continued,&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, we will get outside the solar system
altogether,&mdash;leave the whole group of sun, primary and
secondary planets quite behind us in our flight, as a bird might
leave its bush and sweep into the whole forest.&nbsp; Now what do
you see, Lady Constantine?&rsquo;&nbsp; He levelled the
achromatic at Sirius.</p>
<p>She said that she saw a bright star, though it only seemed a
point of light now as before.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s because it is so distant that no
magnifying will bring its size up to zero.&nbsp; Though called a
fixed star, it is, like all fixed stars, moving with
inconceivable velocity; but no magnifying will show that velocity
as anything but rest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And thus they talked on about Sirius, and then about other
stars</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. . . in the scrowl<br />
Of all those beasts, and fish, and fowl,<br />
With which, like Indian plantations,<br />
The learned stock the constellations,</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="nind">till he asked her how many stars she thought were visible to
them at that moment.</p>
<p>She looked around over the magnificent stretch of sky that
their high position unfolded.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, thousands,
hundreds of thousands,&rsquo; she said absently.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&nbsp; There are only about three thousand.&nbsp;
Now, how many do you think are brought within sight by the help
of a powerful telescope?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I won&rsquo;t guess.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Twenty millions.&nbsp; So that, whatever the stars were
made for, they were not made to please our eyes.&nbsp; It is just
the same in everything; nothing is made for man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it that notion which makes you so sad for your
age?&rsquo; she asked, with almost maternal solicitude.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I think astronomy is a bad study for you.&nbsp; It makes
you feel human insignificance too plainly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps it does.&nbsp; However,&rsquo; he added more
cheerfully, &lsquo;though I feel the study to be one almost
tragic in its quality, I hope to be the new Copernicus.&nbsp;
What he was to the solar system I aim to be to the systems
beyond.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then, by means of the instrument at hand, they travelled
together from the earth to Uranus and the mysterious outskirts of
the solar system; from the solar system to a star in the Swan,
the nearest fixed star in the northern sky; from the star in the
Swan to remoter stars; thence to the remotest visible; till the
ghastly chasm which they had bridged by a fragile line of sight
was realized by Lady Constantine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are now traversing distances beside which the
immense line stretching from the earth to the sun is but an
invisible point,&rsquo; said the youth.&nbsp; &lsquo;When, just
now, we had reached a planet whose remoteness is a hundred times
the remoteness of the sun from the earth, we were only a two
thousandth part of the journey to the spot at which we have
optically arrived now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, pray don&rsquo;t; it overpowers me!&rsquo; she
replied, not without seriousness.&nbsp; &lsquo;It makes me feel
that it is not worth while to live; it quite annihilates
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If it annihilates your ladyship to roam over these
yawning spaces just once, think how it must annihilate me to be,
as it were, in constant suspension amid them night after
night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes. . . .&nbsp; It was not really this subject that I
came to see you upon, Mr. St. Cleeve,&rsquo; she began a second
time.&nbsp; &lsquo;It was a personal matter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am listening, Lady Constantine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will tell it you.&nbsp; Yet no,&mdash;not this
moment.&nbsp; Let us finish this grand subject first; it dwarfs
mine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It would have been difficult to judge from her accents whether
she were afraid to broach her own matter, or really interested in
his.&nbsp; Or a certain youthful pride that he evidenced at being
the elucidator of such a large theme, and at having drawn her
there to hear and observe it, may have inclined her to indulge
him for kindness&rsquo; sake.</p>
<p>Thereupon he took exception to her use of the word
&lsquo;grand&rsquo; as descriptive of the actual universe:</p>
<p>&lsquo;The imaginary picture of the sky as the concavity of a
dome whose base extends from horizon to horizon of our earth is
grand, simply grand, and I wish I had never got beyond looking at
it in that way.&nbsp; But the actual sky is a horror.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A new view of our old friends, the stars,&rsquo; she
said, smiling up at them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But such an obviously true one!&rsquo; said the young
man.&nbsp; &lsquo;You would hardly think, at first, that horrid
monsters lie up there waiting to be discovered by any moderately
penetrating mind&mdash;monsters to which those of the oceans bear
no sort of comparison.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What monsters may they be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Impersonal monsters, namely, Immensities.&nbsp; Until a
person has thought out the stars and their inter-spaces, he has
hardly learnt that there are things much more terrible than
monsters of shape, namely, monsters of magnitude without known
shape.&nbsp; Such monsters are the voids and waste places of the
sky.&nbsp; Look, for instance, at those pieces of darkness in the
Milky Way,&rsquo; he went on, pointing with his finger to where
the galaxy stretched across over their heads with the
luminousness of a frosted web.&nbsp; &lsquo;You see that dark
opening in it near the Swan?&nbsp; There is a still more
remarkable one south of the equator, called the Coal Sack, as a
sort of nickname that has a farcical force from its very
inadequacy.&nbsp; In these our sight plunges quite beyond any
twinkler we have yet visited.&nbsp; Those are deep wells for the
human mind to let itself down into, leave alone the human body!
and think of the side caverns and secondary abysses to right and
left as you pass on!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lady Constantine was heedful and silent.</p>
<p>He tried to give her yet another idea of the size of the
universe; never was there a more ardent endeavour to bring down
the immeasurable to human comprehension!&nbsp; By figures of
speech and apt comparisons he took her mind into leading-strings,
compelling her to follow him into wildernesses of which she had
never in her life even realized the existence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is a size at which dignity begins,&rsquo; he
exclaimed; &lsquo;further on there is a size at which grandeur
begins; further on there is a size at which solemnity begins;
further on, a size at which awfulness begins; further on, a size
at which ghastliness begins.&nbsp; That size faintly approaches
the size of the stellar universe.&nbsp; So am I not right in
saying that those minds who exert their imaginative powers to
bury themselves in the depths of that universe merely strain
their faculties to gain a new horror?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Standing, as she stood, in the presence of the stellar
universe, under the very eyes of the constellations, Lady
Constantine apprehended something of the earnest youth&rsquo;s
argument.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And to add a new weirdness to what the sky possesses in
its size and formlessness, there is involved the quality of
decay.&nbsp; For all the wonder of these everlasting stars,
eternal spheres, and what not, they are not everlasting, they are
not eternal; they burn out like candles.&nbsp; You see that dying
one in the body of the Greater Bear?&nbsp; Two centuries ago it
was as bright as the others.&nbsp; The senses may become
terrified by plunging among them as they are, but there is a
pitifulness even in their glory.&nbsp; Imagine them all
extinguished, and your mind feeling its way through a heaven of
total darkness, occasionally striking against the black,
invisible cinders of those stars. . . .&nbsp; If you are
cheerful, and wish to remain so, leave the study of astronomy
alone.&nbsp; Of all the sciences, it alone deserves the character
of the terrible.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not altogether cheerful.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then if, on the other hand, you are restless and
anxious about the future, study astronomy at once.&nbsp; Your
troubles will be reduced amazingly.&nbsp; But your study will
reduce them in a singular way, by reducing the importance of
everything.&nbsp; So that the science is still terrible, even as
a panacea.&nbsp; It is quite impossible to think at all
adequately of the sky&mdash;of what the sky substantially is,
without feeling it as a juxtaposed nightmare.&nbsp; It is
better&mdash;far better&mdash;for men to forget the universe than
to bear it clearly in mind! . . .&nbsp; But you say the universe
was not really what you came to see me about.&nbsp; What was it,
may I ask, Lady Constantine?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She mused, and sighed, and turned to him with something
pathetic in her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The immensity of the subject you have engaged me on has
completely crushed my subject out of me!&nbsp; Yours is
celestial; mine lamentably human!&nbsp; And the less must give
way to the greater.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But is it, in a human sense, and apart from macrocosmic
magnitudes, important?&rsquo; he inquired, at last attracted by
her manner; for he began to perceive, in spite of his
prepossession, that she had really something on her mind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is as important as personal troubles usually
are.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Notwithstanding her preconceived notion of coming to Swithin
as employer to dependant, as <i>ch&acirc;telaine</i> to page, she
was falling into confidential intercourse with him.&nbsp; His
vast and romantic endeavours lent him a personal force and charm
which she could not but apprehend.&nbsp; In the presence of the
immensities that his young mind had, as it were, brought down
from above to hers, they became unconsciously equal.&nbsp; There
was, moreover, an inborn liking in Lady Constantine to dwell less
on her permanent position as a county lady than on her passing
emotions as a woman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will postpone the matter I came to charge you
with,&rsquo; she resumed, smiling.&nbsp; &lsquo;I must reconsider
it.&nbsp; Now I will return.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Allow me to show you out through the trees and across
the fields?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She said neither a distinct yes nor no; and, descending the
tower, they threaded the firs and crossed the ploughed
field.&nbsp; By an odd coincidence he remarked, when they drew
near the Great House&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You may possibly be interested in knowing, Lady
Constantine, that that medium-sized star you see over there, low
down in the south, is precisely over Sir Blount
Constantine&rsquo;s head in the middle of Africa.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How very strange that you should have said so!&rsquo;
she answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;You have broached for me the very
subject I had come to speak of.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;On a domestic matter?&rsquo; he said, with
surprise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; What a small matter it seems now, after our
astronomical stupendousness! and yet on my way to you it so far
transcended the ordinary matters of my life as the subject you
have led me up to transcends this.&nbsp; But,&rsquo; with a
little laugh, &lsquo;I will endeavour to sink down to such
ephemeral trivialities as human tragedy, and explain, since I
have come.&nbsp; The point is, I want a helper: no woman ever
wanted one more.&nbsp; For days I have wanted a trusty friend who
could go on a secret errand for me.&nbsp; It is necessary that my
messenger should be educated, should be intelligent, should be
silent as the grave.&nbsp; Do you give me your solemn promise as
to the last point, if I confide in you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Most emphatically, Lady Constantine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your right hand upon the compact.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He gave his hand, and raised hers to his lips.&nbsp; In
addition to his respect for her as the lady of the manor, there
was the admiration of twenty years for twenty-eight or nine in
such relations.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I trust you,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now, beyond
the above conditions, it was specially necessary that my agent
should have known Sir Blount Constantine well by sight when he
was at home.&nbsp; For the errand is concerning my husband; I am
much disturbed at what I have heard about him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am indeed sorry to know it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There are only two people in the parish who fulfil all
the conditions,&mdash;Mr. Torkingham, and yourself.&nbsp; I sent
for Mr. Torkingham, and he came.&nbsp; I could not tell
him.&nbsp; I felt at the last moment that he wouldn&rsquo;t
do.&nbsp; I have come to you because I think you will do.&nbsp;
This is it: my husband has led me and all the world to believe
that he is in Africa, hunting lions.&nbsp; I have had a
mysterious letter informing me that he has been seen in London,
in very peculiar circumstances.&nbsp; The truth of this I want
ascertained.&nbsp; Will you go on the journey?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Personally, I would go to the end of the world for you,
Lady Constantine; but&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No buts!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How can I leave?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am preparing a work on variable stars.&nbsp; There is
one of these which I have exceptionally observed for several
months, and on this my great theory is mainly based.&nbsp; It has
been hitherto called irregular; but I have detected a periodicity
in its so-called irregularities which, if proved, would add some
very valuable facts to those known on this subject, one of the
most interesting, perplexing, and suggestive in the whole field
of astronomy.&nbsp; Now, to clinch my theory, there should be a
sudden variation this week,&mdash;or at latest next
week,&mdash;and I have to watch every night not to let it
pass.&nbsp; You see my reason for declining, Lady
Constantine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Young men are always so selfish!&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It might ruin the whole of my year&rsquo;s labour if I
leave now!&rsquo; returned the youth, greatly hurt.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Could you not wait a fortnight longer?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&mdash;no.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t think that I have asked
you, pray.&nbsp; I have no wish to inconvenience you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lady Constantine, don&rsquo;t be angry with me!&nbsp;
Will you do this,&mdash;watch the star for me while I am
gone?&nbsp; If you are prepared to do it effectually, I will
go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will it be much trouble?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It will be some trouble.&nbsp; You would have to come
here every clear evening about nine.&nbsp; If the sky were not
clear, then you would have to come at four in the morning, should
the clouds have dispersed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Could not the telescope be brought to my
house?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Swithin shook his head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps you did not observe its real size,&mdash;that
it was fixed to a frame-work?&nbsp; I could not afford to buy an
equatorial, and I have been obliged to rig up an apparatus of my
own devising, so as to make it in some measure answer the purpose
of an equatorial.&nbsp; It <i>could</i> be moved, but I would
rather not touch it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll go to the telescope,&rsquo; she went
on, with an emphasis that was not wholly playful.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You are the most ungallant youth I ever met with; but I
suppose I must set that down to science.&nbsp; Yes, I&rsquo;ll go
to the tower at nine every night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And alone?&nbsp; I should prefer to keep my pursuits
there unknown.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And alone,&rsquo; she answered, quite overborne by his
inflexibility.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will not miss the morning observation, if it should
be necessary?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have given my word.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I give mine.&nbsp; I suppose I ought not to have
been so exacting!&rsquo;&nbsp; He spoke with that sudden
emotional sense of his own insignificance which made these
alternations of mood possible.&nbsp; &lsquo;I will go
anywhere&mdash;do anything for you&mdash;this
moment&mdash;to-morrow or at any time.&nbsp; But you must return
with me to the tower, and let me show you the observing
process.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They retraced their steps, the tender hoar-frost taking the
imprint of their feet, while two stars in the Twins looked down
upon their two persons through the trees, as if those two persons
could bear some sort of comparison with them.&nbsp; On the tower
the instructions were given.&nbsp; When all was over, and he was
again conducting her to the Great House she said&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When can you start?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said Swithin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So much the better.&nbsp; You shall go up by the night
mail.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>V</h3>
<p>On the third morning after the young man&rsquo;s departure
Lady Constantine opened the post-bag anxiously.&nbsp; Though she
had risen before four o&rsquo;clock, and crossed to the tower
through the gray half-light when every blade and twig were furred
with rime, she felt no languor.&nbsp; Expectation could banish at
cock-crow the eye-heaviness which apathy had been unable to
disperse all the day long.</p>
<p>There was, as she had hoped, a letter from Swithin St.
Cleeve.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Lady
Constantine</span>,&mdash;I have quite succeeded in my mission,
and shall return to-morrow at 10 p.m.&nbsp; I hope you have not
failed in the observations.&nbsp; Watching the star through an
opera-glass Sunday night, I fancied some change had taken place,
but I could not make myself sure.&nbsp; Your memoranda for that
night I await with impatience.&nbsp; Please don&rsquo;t neglect
to write down <i>at the moment</i>, all remarkable appearances
both as to colour and intensity; and be very exact as to time,
which correct in the way I showed you.&mdash;I am, dear Lady
Constantine, yours most faithfully,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Swithin St.
Cleeve</span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not another word in the letter about his errand; his mind ran
on nothing but this astronomical subject.&nbsp; He had succeeded
in his mission, and yet he did not even say yes or no to the
great question,&mdash;whether or not her husband was masquerading
in London at the address she had given.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was ever anything so provoking!&rsquo; she cried.</p>
<p>However, the time was not long to wait.&nbsp; His way homeward
would lie within a stone&rsquo;s-throw of the manor-house, and
though for certain reasons she had forbidden him to call at the
late hour of his arrival, she could easily intercept him in the
avenue.&nbsp; At twenty minutes past ten she went out into the
drive, and stood in the dark.&nbsp; Seven minutes later she heard
his footstep, and saw his outline in the slit of light between
the avenue-trees.&nbsp; He had a valise in one hand, a great-coat
on his arm, and under his arm a parcel which seemed to be very
precious, from the manner in which he held it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lady Constantine?&rsquo; he asked softly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she said, in her excitement holding out
both her hands, though he had plainly not expected her to offer
one.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you watch the star?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you everything in detail; but, pray,
your errand first!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s all right.&nbsp; Did you watch every
night, not missing one?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I forgot to go&mdash;twice,&rsquo; she murmured
contritely.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Lady Constantine!&rsquo; he cried in dismay.&nbsp;
&lsquo;How could you serve me so! what shall I do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Please forgive me!&nbsp; Indeed, I could not help
it.&nbsp; I had watched and watched, and nothing happened; and
somehow my vigilance relaxed when I found nothing was likely to
take place in the star.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But the very circumstance of it not having happened,
made it all the more likely every day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you&mdash;seen&mdash;&rsquo; she began
imploringly.</p>
<p>Swithin sighed, lowered his thoughts to sublunary things, and
told briefly the story of his journey.&nbsp; Sir Blount
Constantine was not in London at the address which had been
anonymously sent her.&nbsp; It was a mistake of identity.&nbsp;
The person who had been seen there Swithin had sought out.&nbsp;
He resembled Sir Blount strongly; but he was a stranger.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How can I reward you!&rsquo; she exclaimed, when he had
done.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In no way but by giving me your good wishes in what I
am going to tell you on my own account.&rsquo;&nbsp; He spoke in
tones of mysterious exultation.&nbsp; &lsquo;This parcel is going
to make my fame!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A huge object-glass for the great telescope I am so
busy about!&nbsp; Such a magnificent aid to science has never
entered this county before, you may depend.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He produced from under his arm the carefully cuddled-up
package, which was in shape a round flat disk, like a
dinner-plate, tied in paper.</p>
<p>Proceeding to explain his plans to her more fully, he walked
with her towards the door by which she had emerged.&nbsp; It was
a little side wicket through a wall dividing the open park from
the garden terraces.&nbsp; Here for a moment he placed his valise
and parcel on the coping of the stone balustrade, till he had
bidden her farewell.&nbsp; Then he turned, and in laying hold of
his bag by the dim light pushed the parcel over the
parapet.&nbsp; It fell smash upon the paved walk ten or a dozen
feet beneath.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, good heavens!&rsquo; he cried in anguish.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My object-glass broken!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it of much value?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It cost all I possess!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He ran round by the steps to the lower lawn, Lady Constantine
following, as he continued, &lsquo;It is a magnificent eight-inch
first quality object lens!&nbsp; I took advantage of my journey
to London to get it!&nbsp; I have been six weeks making the tube
of milled board; and as I had not enough money by twelve pounds
for the lens, I borrowed it of my grandmother out of her last
annuity payment.&nbsp; What can be, can be done!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps it is not broken.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He felt on the ground, found the parcel, and shook it.&nbsp; A
clicking noise issued from inside.&nbsp; Swithin smote his
forehead with his hand, and walked up and down like a mad
fellow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My telescope!&nbsp; I have waited nine months for this
lens.&nbsp; Now the possibility of setting up a really powerful
instrument is over!&nbsp; It is too cruel&mdash;how could it
happen! . . .&nbsp; Lady Constantine, I am ashamed of
myself,&mdash;before you.&nbsp; Oh, but, Lady Constantine, if you
only knew what it is to a person engaged in science to have the
means of clinching a theory snatched away at the last
moment!&nbsp; It is I against the world; and when the world has
accidents on its side in addition to its natural strength, what
chance for me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The young astronomer leant against the wall, and was
silent.&nbsp; His misery was of an intensity and kind with that
of Palissy, in these struggles with an adverse fate.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t mind it,&mdash;pray don&rsquo;t!&rsquo;
said Lady Constantine.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is dreadfully
unfortunate!&nbsp; You have my whole sympathy.&nbsp; Can it be
mended?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mended,&mdash;no, no!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cannot you do with your present one a little
longer?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is altogether inferior, cheap, and bad!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll get you another,&mdash;yes, indeed, I
will!&nbsp; Allow me to get you another as soon as
possible.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll do anything to assist you out of your
trouble; for I am most anxious to see you famous.&nbsp; I know
you will be a great astronomer, in spite of this mishap!&nbsp;
Come, say I may get a new one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Swithin took her hand.&nbsp; He could not trust himself to
speak.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Some days later a little box of peculiar kind came to the
Great House.&nbsp; It was addressed to Lady Constantine,
&lsquo;with great care.&rsquo;&nbsp; She had it partly opened and
taken to her own little writing-room; and after lunch, when she
had dressed for walking, she took from the box a paper parcel
like the one which had met with the accident.&nbsp; This she hid
under her mantle, as if she had stolen it; and, going out slowly
across the lawn, passed through the little door before spoken of,
and was soon hastening in the direction of the Rings-Hill
column.</p>
<p>There was a bright sun overhead on that afternoon of early
spring, and its rays shed an unusual warmth on south-west
aspects, though shady places still retained the look and feel of
winter.&nbsp; Rooks were already beginning to build new nests or
to mend up old ones, and clamorously called in neighbours to give
opinions on difficulties in their architecture.&nbsp; Lady
Constantine swerved once from her path, as if she had decided to
go to the homestead where Swithin lived; but on second thoughts
she bent her steps to the column.</p>
<p>Drawing near it she looked up; but by reason of the height of
the parapet nobody could be seen thereon who did not stand on
tiptoe.&nbsp; She thought, however, that her young friend might
possibly see her, if he were there, and come down; and that he
was there she soon ascertained by finding the door unlocked, and
the key inside.&nbsp; No movement, however, reached her ears from
above, and she began to ascend.</p>
<p>Meanwhile affairs at the top of the column had progressed as
follows.&nbsp; The afternoon being exceptionally fine, Swithin
had ascended about two o&rsquo;clock, and, seating himself at the
little table which he had constructed on the spot, he began
reading over his notes and examining some astronomical journals
that had reached him in the morning.&nbsp; The sun blazed into
the hollow roof-space as into a tub, and the sides kept out every
breeze.&nbsp; Though the month was February below it was May in
the abacus of the column.&nbsp; This state of the atmosphere, and
the fact that on the previous night he had pursued his
observations till past two o&rsquo;clock, produced in him at the
end of half an hour an overpowering inclination to sleep.&nbsp;
Spreading on the lead-work a thick rug which he kept up there, he
flung himself down against the parapet, and was soon in a state
of unconsciousness.</p>
<p>It was about ten minutes afterwards that a soft rustle of
silken clothes came up the spiral staircase, and, hesitating
onwards, reached the orifice, where appeared the form of Lady
Constantine.&nbsp; She did not at first perceive that he was
present, and stood still to reconnoitre.&nbsp; Her eye glanced
over his telescope, now wrapped up, his table and papers, his
observing-chair, and his contrivances for making the best of a
deficiency of instruments.&nbsp; All was warm, sunny, and silent,
except that a solitary bee, which had somehow got within the
hollow of the abacus, was singing round inquiringly, unable to
discern that ascent was the only mode of escape.&nbsp; In another
moment she beheld the astronomer, lying in the sun like a sailor
in the main-top.</p>
<p>Lady Constantine coughed slightly; he did not awake.&nbsp; She
then entered, and, drawing the parcel from beneath her cloak,
placed it on the table.&nbsp; After this she waited, looking for
a long time at his sleeping face, which had a very interesting
appearance.&nbsp; She seemed reluctant to leave, yet wanted
resolution to wake him; and, pencilling his name on the parcel,
she withdrew to the staircase, where the brushing of her dress
decreased to silence as she receded round and round on her way to
the base.</p>
<p>Swithin still slept on, and presently the rustle began again
in the far-down interior of the column.&nbsp; The door could be
heard closing, and the rustle came nearer, showing that she had
shut herself in,&mdash;no doubt to lessen the risk of an
accidental surprise by any roaming villager.&nbsp; When Lady
Constantine reappeared at the top, and saw the parcel still
untouched and Swithin asleep as before, she exhibited some
disappointment; but she did not retreat.</p>
<p>Looking again at him, her eyes became so sentimentally fixed
on his face that it seemed as if she could not withdraw
them.&nbsp; There lay, in the shape of an Antinous, no
<i>amoroso</i>, no gallant, but a guileless philosopher.&nbsp;
His parted lips were lips which spoke, not of love, but of
millions of miles; those were eyes which habitually gazed, not
into the depths of other eyes, but into other worlds.&nbsp;
Within his temples dwelt thoughts, not of woman&rsquo;s looks,
but of stellar aspects and the configuration of
constellations.</p>
<p>Thus, to his physical attractiveness was added the
attractiveness of mental inaccessibility.&nbsp; The ennobling
influence of scientific pursuits was demonstrated by the
speculative purity which expressed itself in his eyes whenever he
looked at her in speaking, and in the childlike faults of manner
which arose from his obtuseness to their difference of sex.&nbsp;
He had never, since becoming a man, looked even so low as to the
level of a Lady Constantine.&nbsp; His heaven at present was
truly in the skies, and not in that only other place where they
say it can be found, in the eyes of some daughter of Eve.&nbsp;
Would any Circe or Calypso&mdash;and if so, what one?&mdash;ever
check this pale-haired scientist&rsquo;s nocturnal sailings into
the interminable spaces overhead, and hurl all his mighty
calculations on cosmic force and stellar fire into Limbo?&nbsp;
Oh, the pity of it, if such should be the case!</p>
<p>She became much absorbed in these very womanly reflections;
and at last Lady Constantine sighed, perhaps she herself did not
exactly know why.&nbsp; Then a very soft expression lighted on
her lips and eyes, and she looked at one jump ten years more
youthful than before&mdash;quite a girl in aspect, younger than
he.&nbsp; On the table lay his implements; among them a pair of
scissors, which, to judge from the shreds around, had been used
in cutting curves in thick paper for some calculating
process.</p>
<p>What whim, agitation, or attraction prompted the impulse,
nobody knows; but she took the scissors, and, bending over the
sleeping youth, cut off one of the curls, or rather
crooks,&mdash;for they hardly reached a curl,&mdash;into which
each lock of his hair chose to twist itself in the last inch of
its length.&nbsp; The hair fell upon the rug.&nbsp; She picked it
up quickly, returned the scissors to the table, and, as if her
dignity had suddenly become ashamed of her fantasies, hastened
through the door, and descended the staircase.</p>
<h3>VI</h3>
<p>When his nap had naturally exhausted itself Swithin
awoke.&nbsp; He awoke without any surprise, for he not
unfrequently gave to sleep in the day-time what he had stolen
from it in the night watches.&nbsp; The first object that met his
eyes was the parcel on the table, and, seeing his name inscribed
thereon, he made no scruple to open it.</p>
<p>The sun flashed upon a lens of surprising magnitude, polished
to such a smoothness that the eye could scarcely meet its
reflections.&nbsp; Here was a crystal in whose depths were to be
seen more wonders than had been revealed by the crystals of all
the Cagliostros.</p>
<p>Swithin, hot with joyousness, took this treasure to his
telescope manufactory at the homestead; then he started off for
the Great House.</p>
<p>On gaining its precincts he felt shy of calling, never having
received any hint or permission to do so; while Lady
Constantine&rsquo;s mysterious manner of leaving the parcel
seemed to demand a like mysteriousness in his approaches to
her.&nbsp; All the afternoon he lingered about uncertainly, in
the hope of intercepting her on her return from a drive,
occasionally walking with an indifferent lounge across glades
commanded by the windows, that if she were in-doors she might
know he was near.&nbsp; But she did not show herself during the
daylight.&nbsp; Still impressed by her playful secrecy he carried
on the same idea after dark, by returning to the house and
passing through the garden door on to the lawn front, where he
sat on the parapet that breasted the terrace.</p>
<p>Now she frequently came out here for a melancholy saunter
after dinner, and to-night was such an occasion.&nbsp; Swithin
went forward, and met her at nearly the spot where he had dropped
the lens some nights earlier.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have come to see you, Lady Constantine.&nbsp; How did
the glass get on my table?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She laughed as lightly as a girl; that he had come to her in
this way was plainly no offence thus far.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps it was dropped from the clouds by a
bird,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why should you be so good to me?&rsquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One good turn deserves another,&rsquo; answered
she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear Lady Constantine!&nbsp; Whatever discoveries
result from this shall be ascribed to you as much as to me.&nbsp;
Where should I have been without your gift?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You would possibly have accomplished your purpose just
the same, and have been so much the nobler for your struggle
against ill-luck.&nbsp; I hope that now you will be able to
proceed with your large telescope as if nothing had
happened.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes, I will, certainly.&nbsp; I am afraid I showed
too much feeling, the reverse of stoical, when the accident
occurred.&nbsp; That was not very noble of me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is nothing unnatural in such feeling at your
age.&nbsp; When you are older you will smile at such moods, and
at the mishaps that gave rise to them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, I perceive you think me weak in the extreme,&rsquo;
he said, with just a shade of pique.&nbsp; &lsquo;But you will
never realize that an incident which filled but a degree in the
circle of your thoughts covered the whole circumference of
mine.&nbsp; No person can see exactly what and where
another&rsquo;s horizon is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They soon parted, and she re-entered the house, where she sat
reflecting for some time, till she seemed to fear that she had
wounded his feelings.&nbsp; She awoke in the night, and thought
and thought on the same thing, till she had worked herself into a
feverish fret about it.&nbsp; When it was morning she looked
across at the tower, and sitting down, impulsively wrote the
following note:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. St.
Cleeve</span>,&mdash;I cannot allow you to remain under the
impression that I despised your scientific endeavours in speaking
as I did last night.&nbsp; I think you were too sensitive to my
remark.&nbsp; But perhaps you were agitated with the labours of
the day, and I fear that watching so late at night must make you
very weary.&nbsp; If I can help you again, please let me
know.&nbsp; I never realized the grandeur of astronomy till you
showed me how to do so.&nbsp; Also let me know about the new
telescope.&nbsp; Come and see me at any time.&nbsp; After your
great kindness in being my messenger I can never do enough for
you.&nbsp; I wish you had a mother or sister, and pity your
loneliness!&nbsp; I am lonely too.&mdash;Yours truly,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Viviette
Constantine</span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She was so anxious that he should get this letter the same day
that she ran across to the column with it during the morning,
preferring to be her own emissary in so curious a case.&nbsp; The
door, as she had expected, was locked; and, slipping the letter
under it, she went home again.&nbsp; During lunch her ardour in
the cause of Swithin&rsquo;s hurt feelings cooled down, till she
exclaimed to herself, as she sat at her lonely table, &lsquo;What
could have possessed me to write in that way!&rsquo;</p>
<p>After lunch she went faster to the tower than she had gone in
the early morning, and peeped eagerly into the chink under the
door.&nbsp; She could discern no letter, and, on trying the
latch, found that the door would open.&nbsp; The letter was gone,
Swithin having obviously arrived in the interval.</p>
<p>She blushed a blush which seemed to say, &lsquo;I am getting
foolishly interested in this young man.&rsquo;&nbsp; She had, in
short, in her own opinion, somewhat overstepped the bounds of
dignity.&nbsp; Her instincts did not square well with the
formalities of her existence, and she walked home
despondently.</p>
<p>Had a concert, bazaar, lecture, or Dorcas meeting required the
patronage and support of Lady Constantine at this juncture, the
circumstance would probably have been sufficient to divert her
mind from Swithin St. Cleeve and astronomy for some little
time.&nbsp; But as none of these incidents were within the range
of expectation&mdash;Welland House and parish lying far from
large towns and watering-places&mdash;the void in her outer life
continued, and with it the void in her life within.</p>
<p>The youth had not answered her letter; neither had he called
upon her in response to the invitation she had regretted, with
the rest of the epistle, as being somewhat too warmly informal
for black and white.&nbsp; To speak tenderly to him was one
thing, to write another&mdash;that was her feeling immediately
after the event; but his counter-move of silence and avoidance,
though probably the result of pure unconsciousness on his part,
completely dispersed such self-considerations now.&nbsp; Her eyes
never fell upon the Rings-Hill column without a solicitous wonder
arising as to what he was doing.&nbsp; A true woman, she would
assume the remotest possibility to be the most likely
contingency, if the possibility had the recommendation of being
tragical; and she now feared that something was wrong with
Swithin St. Cleeve.&nbsp; Yet there was not the least doubt that
he had become so immersed in the business of the new telescope as
to forget everything else.</p>
<p>On Sunday, between the services, she walked to Little Welland,
chiefly for the sake of giving a run to a house-dog, a large St.
Bernard, of whom she was fond.&nbsp; The distance was but short;
and she returned along a narrow lane, divided from the river by a
hedge, through whose leafless twigs the ripples flashed silver
lights into her eyes.&nbsp; Here she discovered Swithin, leaning
over a gate, his eyes bent upon the stream.</p>
<p>The dog first attracted his attention; then he heard her, and
turned round.&nbsp; She had never seen him looking so
despondent.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have never called, though I invited you,&rsquo;
said Lady Constantine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My great telescope won&rsquo;t work!&rsquo; he replied
lugubriously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sorry for that.&nbsp; So it has made you quite
forget me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, yes; you wrote me a very kind letter, which I ought
to have answered.&nbsp; Well, I <i>did</i> forget, Lady
Constantine.&nbsp; My new telescope won&rsquo;t work, and I
don&rsquo;t know what to do about it at all!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can I assist you any further?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I fear not.&nbsp; Besides, you have assisted me
already.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What would really help you out of all your
difficulties?&nbsp; Something would, surely?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There must be some solution to them?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes,&rsquo; he replied, with a hypothetical gaze into
the stream; &lsquo;<i>some</i> solution of course&mdash;an
equatorial, for instance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Briefly, an impossibility.&nbsp; It is a splendid
instrument, with an object lens of, say, eight or nine inches
aperture, mounted with its axis parallel to the earth&rsquo;s
axis, and fitted up with graduated circles for denoting right
ascensions and declinations; besides having special eye-pieces, a
finder, and all sorts of appliances&mdash;clock-work to make the
telescope follow the motion in right ascension&mdash;I cannot
tell you half the conveniences.&nbsp; Ah, an equatorial is a
thing indeed!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;An equatorial is the one instrument required to make
you quite happy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll see what I can do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, Lady Constantine,&rsquo; cried the amazed
astronomer, &lsquo;an equatorial such as I describe costs as much
as two grand pianos!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She was rather staggered at this news; but she rallied
gallantly, and said, &lsquo;Never mind.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll make
inquiries.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But it could not be put on the tower without people
seeing it!&nbsp; It would have to be fixed to the masonry.&nbsp;
And there must be a dome of some kind to keep off the rain.&nbsp;
A tarpaulin might do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lady Constantine reflected.&nbsp; &lsquo;It would be a great
business, I see,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Though as far as
the fixing and roofing go, I would of course consent to your
doing what you liked with the old column.&nbsp; My workmen could
fix it, could they not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes.&nbsp; But what would Sir Blount say, if he came
home and saw the goings on?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lady Constantine turned aside to hide a sudden displacement of
blood from her cheek.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah&mdash;my husband!&rsquo;
she whispered. . . .&nbsp; &lsquo;I am just now going to
church,&rsquo; she added in a repressed and hurried tone.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I will think of this matter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In church it was with Lady Constantine as with the Lord Angelo
of Vienna in a similar situation&mdash;Heaven had her empty words
only, and her invention heard not her tongue.&nbsp; She soon
recovered from the momentary consternation into which she had
fallen at Swithin&rsquo;s abrupt query.&nbsp; The possibility of
that young astronomer becoming a renowned scientist by her aid
was a thought which gave her secret pleasure.&nbsp; The course of
rendering him instant material help began to have a great
fascination for her; it was a new and unexpected channel for her
cribbed and confined emotions.&nbsp; With experiences so much
wider than his, Lady Constantine saw that the chances were
perhaps a million to one against Swithin St. Cleeve ever being
Astronomer Royal, or Astronomer Extraordinary of any sort; yet
the remaining chance in his favour was one of those possibilities
which, to a woman of bounding intellect and venturesome fancy,
are pleasanter to dwell on than likely issues that have no savour
of high speculation in them.&nbsp; The equatorial question was a
great one; and she had caught such a large spark from his
enthusiasm that she could think of nothing so piquant as how to
obtain the important instrument.</p>
<p>When Tabitha Lark arrived at the Great House next day, instead
of finding Lady Constantine in bed, as formerly, she discovered
her in the library, poring over what astronomical works she had
been able to unearth from the worm-eaten shelves.&nbsp; As these
publications were, for a science of such rapid development,
somewhat venerable, there was not much help of a practical kind
to be gained from them.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the equatorial
retained a hold upon her fancy, till she became as eager to see
one on the Rings-Hill column as Swithin himself.</p>
<p>The upshot of it was that Lady Constantine sent a messenger
that evening to Welland Bottom, where the homestead of
Swithin&rsquo;s grandmother was situated, requesting the young
man&rsquo;s presence at the house at twelve o&rsquo;clock next
day.</p>
<p>He hurriedly returned an obedient reply, and the promise was
enough to lend great freshness to her manner next morning,
instead of the leaden air which was too frequent with her before
the sun reached the meridian, and sometimes after.&nbsp; Swithin
had, in fact, arisen as an attractive little intervention between
herself and despair.</p>
<h3>VII</h3>
<p>A fog defaced all the trees of the park that morning, the
white atmosphere adhered to the ground like a fungoid growth from
it, and made the turfed undulations look slimy and raw.&nbsp; But
Lady Constantine settled down in her chair to await the coming of
the late curate&rsquo;s son with a serenity which the vast blanks
outside could neither baffle nor destroy.</p>
<p>At two minutes to twelve the door-bell rang, and a look
overspread the lady&rsquo;s face that was neither maternal,
sisterly, nor amorous; but partook in an indescribable manner of
all three kinds.&nbsp; The door was flung open and the young man
was ushered in, the fog still clinging to his hair, in which she
could discern a little notch where she had nipped off the
curl.</p>
<p>A speechlessness that socially was a defect in him was to her
view a piquant attribute just now.&nbsp; He looked somewhat
alarmed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lady Constantine, have I done anything, that you have
sent&mdash;?&rsquo; he began breathlessly, as he gazed in her
face, with parted lips.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no, of course not!&nbsp; I have decided to do
something,&mdash;nothing more,&rsquo; she smilingly said, holding
out her hand, which he rather gingerly touched.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t look so concerned.&nbsp; Who makes
equatorials?&rsquo;</p>
<p>This remark was like the drawing of a weir-hatch and she was
speedily inundated with all she wished to know concerning
astronomical opticians.&nbsp; When he had imparted the
particulars he waited, manifestly burning to know whither these
inquiries tended.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not going to buy you one,&rsquo; she said
gently.</p>
<p>He looked as if he would faint.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly not.&nbsp; I do not wish it.&nbsp;
I&mdash;could not have accepted it,&rsquo; faltered the young
man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I am going to buy one for <i>myself</i>.&nbsp; I
lack a hobby, and I shall choose astronomy.&nbsp; I shall fix my
equatorial on the column.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Swithin brightened up.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I shall let you have the use of it whenever you
choose.&nbsp; In brief, Swithin St. Cleeve shall be Lady
Constantine&rsquo;s Astronomer Royal; and she&mdash;and
she&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shall be his Queen.&rsquo;&nbsp; The words came not
much the worse for being uttered only in the tone of one anxious
to complete a tardy sentence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, that&rsquo;s what I have decided to do,&rsquo;
resumed Lady Constantine.&nbsp; &lsquo;I will write to these
opticians at once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There seemed to be no more for him to do than to thank her for
the privilege, whenever it should be available, which he promptly
did, and then made as if to go.&nbsp; But Lady Constantine
detained him with, &lsquo;Have you ever seen my
library?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; never.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t say you would like to see
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I should.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is the third door on the right.&nbsp; You can find
your way in, and you can stay there as long as you
like.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Swithin then left the morning-room for the apartment
designated, and amused himself in that &lsquo;soul of the
house,&rsquo; as Cicero defined it, till he heard the lunch bell
sounding from the turret, when he came down from the library
steps, and thought it time to go home.&nbsp; But at that moment a
servant entered to inquire whether he would or would not prefer
to have his lunch brought in to him there; upon his replying in
the affirmative a large tray arrived on the stomach of a footman,
and Swithin was greatly surprised to see a whole pheasant placed
at his disposal.</p>
<p>Having breakfasted at eight that morning, and having been much
in the open air afterwards, the Adonis-astronomer&rsquo;s
appetite assumed grand proportions.&nbsp; How much of that
pheasant he might consistently eat without hurting his dear
patroness Lady Constantine&rsquo;s feelings, when he could
readily eat it all, was a problem in which the reasonableness of
a larger and larger quantity argued itself inversely as a smaller
and smaller quantity remained.&nbsp; When, at length, he had
finally decided on a terminal point in the body of the bird, the
door was gently opened.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, you have not finished?&rsquo; came to him over his
shoulder, in a considerate voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes, thank you, Lady Constantine,&rsquo; he said,
jumping up.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why did you prefer to lunch in this awkward, dusty
place?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought&mdash;it would be better,&rsquo; said Swithin
simply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is fruit in the other room, if you like to
come.&nbsp; But perhaps you would rather not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes, I should much like to,&rsquo; said Swithin,
walking over his napkin, and following her as she led the way to
the adjoining apartment.</p>
<p>Here, while she asked him what he had been reading, he
modestly ventured on an apple, in whose flavour he recognized the
familiar taste of old friends robbed from her husband&rsquo;s
orchards in his childhood, long before Lady Constantine&rsquo;s
advent on the scene.&nbsp; She supposed he had confined his
search to his own sublime subject, astronomy?</p>
<p>Swithin suddenly became older to the eye, as his thoughts
reverted to the topic thus reintroduced.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo;
he informed her.&nbsp; &lsquo;I seldom read any other
subject.&nbsp; In these days the secret of productive study is to
avoid well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you find any good treatises?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;None.&nbsp; The theories in your books are almost as
obsolete as the Ptolemaic System.&nbsp; Only fancy, that
magnificent Cyclop&aelig;dia, leather-bound, and stamped, and
gilt, and wide margined, and bearing the blazon of your house in
magnificent colours, says that the twinkling of the stars is
probably caused by heavenly bodies passing in front of them in
their revolutions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And is it not so?&nbsp; That was what I learned when I
was a girl.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The modern Eudoxus now rose above the embarrassing horizon of
Lady Constantine&rsquo;s great house, magnificent furniture, and
awe-inspiring footman.&nbsp; He became quite natural, all his
self-consciousness fled, and his eye spoke into hers no less than
his lips to her ears, as he said, &lsquo;How such a theory can
have lingered on to this day beats conjecture!&nbsp; Francois
Arago, as long as forty or fifty years ago, conclusively
established the fact that scintillation is the simplest thing in
the world,&mdash;merely a matter of atmosphere.&nbsp; But I
won&rsquo;t speak of this to you now.&nbsp; The comparative
absence of scintillation in warm countries was noticed by
Humboldt.&nbsp; Then, again, the scintillations vary.&nbsp; No
star flaps his wings like Sirius when he lies low!&nbsp; He
flashes out emeralds and rubies, amethystine flames and
sapphirine colours, in a manner quite marvellous to behold, and
this is only <i>one</i> star!&nbsp; So, too, do Arcturus, and
Capella, and lesser luminaries. . . .&nbsp; But I tire you with
this subject?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;On the contrary, you speak so beautifully that I could
listen all day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The astronomer threw a searching glance upon her for a moment;
but there was no satire in the warm soft eyes which met his own
with a luxurious contemplative interest.&nbsp; &lsquo;Say some
more of it to me,&rsquo; she continued, in a voice not far
removed from coaxing.</p>
<p>After some hesitation the subject returned again to his lips,
and he said some more&mdash;indeed, much more; Lady Constantine
often throwing in an appreciative remark or question, often
meditatively regarding him, in pursuance of ideas not exactly
based on his words, and letting him go on as he would.</p>
<p>Before he left the house the new astronomical project was set
in train.&nbsp; The top of the column was to be roofed in, to
form a proper observatory; and on the ground that he knew better
than any one else how this was to be carried out, she requested
him to give precise directions on the point, and to superintend
the whole.&nbsp; A wooden cabin was to be erected at the foot of
the tower, to provide better accommodation for casual visitors to
the observatory than the spiral staircase and lead-flat
afforded.&nbsp; As this cabin would be completely buried in the
dense fir foliage which enveloped the lower part of the column
and its pedestal, it would be no disfigurement to the general
appearance.&nbsp; Finally, a path was to be made across the
surrounding fallow, by which she might easily approach the scene
of her new study.</p>
<p>When he was gone she wrote to the firm of opticians concerning
the equatorial for whose reception all this was designed.</p>
<p>The undertaking was soon in full progress; and by degrees it
became the talk of the hamlets round that Lady Constantine had
given up melancholy for astronomy, to the great advantage of all
who came in contact with her.&nbsp; One morning, when Tabitha
Lark had come as usual to read, Lady Constantine chanced to be in
a quarter of the house to which she seldom wandered; and while
here she heard her maid talking confidentially to Tabitha in the
adjoining room on the curious and sudden interest which Lady
Constantine had acquired in the moon and stars.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They do say all sorts of trumpery,&rsquo; observed the
handmaid.&nbsp; &lsquo;They say&mdash;though &rsquo;tis little
better than mischief, to be sure&mdash;that it isn&rsquo;t the
moon, and it isn&rsquo;t the stars, and it isn&rsquo;t the
plannards, that my lady cares for, but for the pretty lad who
draws &rsquo;em down from the sky to please her; and being a
married example, and what with sin and shame knocking at every
poor maid&rsquo;s door afore you can say, &ldquo;Hands off, my
dear,&rdquo; to the civilest young man, she ought to set a better
pattern.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lady Constantine&rsquo;s face flamed up vividly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If Sir Blount were to come back all of a
sudden&mdash;oh, my!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lady Constantine grew cold as ice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s nothing in it,&rsquo; said Tabitha
scornfully.&nbsp; &lsquo;I could prove it any day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I wish I had half her chance!&rsquo; sighed the
lady&rsquo;s maid.&nbsp; And no more was said on the subject
then.</p>
<p>Tabitha&rsquo;s remark showed that the suspicion was quite in
embryo as yet.&nbsp; Nevertheless, saying nothing to reveal what
she had overheard, immediately after the reading Lady Constantine
flew like a bird to where she knew that Swithin might be
found.</p>
<p>He was in the plantation, setting up little sticks to mark
where the wooden cabin was to stand.&nbsp; She called him to a
remote place under the funereal trees.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have altered my mind,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
can have nothing to do with this matter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed?&rsquo; said Swithin, surprised.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Astronomy is not my hobby any longer.&nbsp; And you are
not my Astronomer Royal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Lady Constantine!&rsquo; cried the youth,
aghast.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, the work is begun!&nbsp; I thought the
equatorial was ordered.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She dropped her voice, though a Jericho shout would not have
been overheard: &lsquo;Of course astronomy is my hobby privately,
and you are to be my Astronomer Royal, and I still furnish the
observatory; but not to the outer world.&nbsp; There is a reason
against my indulgence in such scientific fancies openly; and the
project must be arranged in this wise.&nbsp; The whole enterprise
is yours: you rent the tower of me: you build the cabin: you get
the equatorial.&nbsp; I simply give permission, since you desire
it.&nbsp; The path that was to be made from the hill to the park
is not to be thought of.&nbsp; There is to be no communication
between the house and the column.&nbsp; The equatorial will
arrive addressed to you, and its cost I will pay through
you.&nbsp; My name must not appear, and I vanish entirely from
the undertaking. . . .&nbsp; This blind is necessary,&rsquo; she
added, sighing.&nbsp; &lsquo;Good-bye!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you <i>do</i> take as much interest as before, and
it <i>will</i> be yours just the same?&rsquo; he said, walking
after her.&nbsp; He scarcely comprehended the subterfuge, and was
absolutely blind as to its reason.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can you doubt it?&nbsp; But I dare not do it
openly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With this she went away; and in due time there circulated
through the parish an assertion that it was a mistake to suppose
Lady Constantine had anything to do with Swithin St. Cleeve or
his star-gazing schemes.&nbsp; She had merely allowed him to rent
the tower of her for use as his observatory, and to put some
temporary fixtures on it for that purpose.</p>
<p>After this Lady Constantine lapsed into her former life of
loneliness; and by these prompt measures the ghost of a rumour
which had barely started into existence was speedily laid to
rest.&nbsp; It had probably originated in her own dwelling, and
had gone but little further.&nbsp; Yet, despite her self-control,
a certain north window of the Great House, that commanded an
uninterrupted view of the upper ten feet of the column, revealed
her to be somewhat frequently gazing from it at a rotundity which
had begun to appear on the summit.&nbsp; To those with whom she
came in contact she sometimes addressed such remarks as,
&lsquo;Is young Mr. St. Cleeve getting on with his
observatory?&nbsp; I hope he will fix his instruments without
damaging the column, which is so interesting to us as being in
memory of my dear husband&rsquo;s great-grandfather&mdash;a truly
brave man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On one occasion her building-steward ventured to suggest to
her that, Sir Blount having deputed to her the power to grant
short leases in his absence, she should have a distinctive
agreement with Swithin, as between landlord and tenant, with a
stringent clause against his driving nails into the stonework of
such an historical memorial.&nbsp; She replied that she did not
wish to be severe on the last representative of such old and
respected parishioners as St. Cleeve&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s
family had been, and of such a well-descended family as his
father&rsquo;s; so that it would only be necessary for the
steward to keep an eye on Mr. St. Cleeve&rsquo;s doings.</p>
<p>Further, when a letter arrived at the Great House from Hilton
and Pimm&rsquo;s, the opticians, with information that the
equatorial was ready and packed, and that a man would be sent
with it to fix it, she replied to that firm to the effect that
their letter should have been addressed to Mr. St. Cleeve, the
local astronomer, on whose behalf she had made the inquiries;
that she had nothing more to do with the matter; that he would
receive the instrument and pay the bill,&mdash;her guarantee
being given for the latter performance.</p>
<h3>VIII</h3>
<p>Lady Constantine then had the pleasure of beholding a waggon,
laden with packing-cases, moving across the field towards the
pillar; and not many days later Swithin, who had never come to
the Great House since the luncheon, met her in a path which he
knew to be one of her promenades.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The equatorial is fixed, and the man gone,&rsquo; he
said, half in doubt as to his speech, for her commands to him not
to recognize her agency or patronage still puzzled him.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I respectfully wish&mdash;you could come and see it, Lady
Constantine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would rather not; I cannot.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Saturn is lovely; Jupiter is simply sublime; I can see
double stars in the Lion and in the Virgin, where I had seen only
a single one before.&nbsp; It is all I required to set me
going!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll come.&nbsp; But&mdash;you need say nothing
about my visit.&nbsp; I cannot come to-night, but I will some
time this week.&nbsp; Yet only this once, to try the
instrument.&nbsp; Afterwards you must be content to pursue your
studies alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Swithin seemed but little affected at this announcement.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Hilton and Pimm&rsquo;s man handed me the bill,&rsquo; he
continued.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How much is it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He told her.&nbsp; &lsquo;And the man who has built the hut
and dome, and done the other fixing, has sent in
his.&rsquo;&nbsp; He named this amount also.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well.&nbsp; They shall be settled with.&nbsp; My
debts must be paid with my money, which you shall have at
once,&mdash;in cash, since a cheque would hardly do.&nbsp; Come
to the house for it this evening.&nbsp; But no, no&mdash;you must
not come openly; such is the world.&nbsp; Come to the
window&mdash;the window that is exactly in a line with the long
snowdrop bed, in the south front&mdash;at eight to-night, and I
will give you what is necessary.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly, Lady Constantine,&rsquo; said the young
man.</p>
<p>At eight that evening accordingly, Swithin entered like a
spectre upon the terrace to seek out the spot she had
designated.&nbsp; The equatorial had so entirely absorbed his
thoughts that he did not trouble himself seriously to conjecture
the why and wherefore of her secrecy.&nbsp; If he casually
thought of it, he set it down in a general way to an intensely
generous wish on her part not to lessen his influence among the
poorer inhabitants by making him appear the object of
patronage.</p>
<p>While he stood by the long snowdrop bed, which looked up at
him like a nether Milky Way, the French casement of the window
opposite softly opened, and a hand bordered by a glimmer of lace
was stretched forth, from which he received a crisp little
parcel,&mdash;bank-notes, apparently.&nbsp; He knew the hand, and
held it long enough to press it to his lips, the only form which
had ever occurred to him of expressing his gratitude to her
without the incumbrance of clumsy words, a vehicle at the best of
times but rudely suited to such delicate merchandise.&nbsp; The
hand was hastily withdrawn, as if the treatment had been
unexpected.&nbsp; Then seemingly moved by second thoughts she
bent forward and said, &lsquo;Is the night good for
observations?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perfect.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She paused.&nbsp; &lsquo;Then I&rsquo;ll come to-night,&rsquo;
she at last said.&nbsp; &lsquo;It makes no difference to me,
after all.&nbsp; Wait just one moment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He waited, and she presently emerged, muffled up like a nun;
whereupon they left the terrace and struck across the park
together.</p>
<p>Very little was said by either till they were crossing the
fallow, when he asked if his arm would help her.&nbsp; She did
not take the offered support just then; but when they were
ascending the prehistoric earthwork, under the heavy gloom of the
fir-trees, she seized it, as if rather influenced by the
oppressive solitude than by fatigue.</p>
<p>Thus they reached the foot of the column, ten thousand spirits
in prison seeming to gasp their griefs from the funereal boughs
overhead, and a few twigs scratching the pillar with the drag of
impish claws as tenacious as those figuring in St.
Anthony&rsquo;s temptation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How intensely dark it is just here!&rsquo; she
whispered.&nbsp; &lsquo;I wonder you can keep in the path.&nbsp;
Many ancient Britons lie buried there doubtless.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He led her round to the other side, where, feeling his way
with his hands, he suddenly left her, appearing a moment after
with a light.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What place is this?&rsquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is the new wood cabin,&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>She could just discern the outline of a little house, not
unlike a bathing-machine without wheels.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have kept lights ready here,&rsquo; he went on,
&lsquo;as I thought you might come any evening, and possibly
bring company.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t criticize me for coming alone,&rsquo; she
exclaimed with sensitive promptness.&nbsp; &lsquo;There are
social reasons for what I do of which you know
nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps it is much to my discredit that I don&rsquo;t
know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not at all.&nbsp; You are all the better for it.&nbsp;
Heaven forbid that I should enlighten you.&nbsp; Well, I see this
is the hut.&nbsp; But I am more curious to go to the top of the
tower, and make discoveries.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He brought a little lantern from the cabin, and lighted her up
the winding staircase to the temple of that sublime mystery on
whose threshold he stood as priest.</p>
<p>The top of the column was quite changed.&nbsp; The tub-shaped
space within the parapet, formerly open to the air and sun, was
now arched over by a light dome of lath-work covered with
felt.&nbsp; But this dome was not fixed.&nbsp; At the line where
its base descended to the parapet there were half a dozen iron
balls, precisely like cannon-shot, standing loosely in a groove,
and on these the dome rested its whole weight.&nbsp; In the side
of the dome was a slit, through which the wind blew and the North
Star beamed, and towards it the end of the great telescope was
directed.&nbsp; This latter magnificent object, with its circles,
axes, and handles complete, was securely fixed in the middle of
the floor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you can only see one part of the sky through that
slit,&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>The astronomer stretched out his arm, and the whole dome
turned horizontally round, running on the balls with a rumble
like thunder.&nbsp; Instead of the star Polaris, which had first
been peeping in through the slit, there now appeared the
countenances of Castor and Pollux.&nbsp; Swithin then manipulated
the equatorial, and put it through its capabilities in like
manner.</p>
<p>She was enchanted; being rather excitable she even clapped her
hands just once.&nbsp; She turned to him: &lsquo;Now are you
happy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But it is all <i>yours</i>, Lady
Constantine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;At this moment.&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s a defect which
can soon be remedied.&nbsp; When is your birthday?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Next month,&mdash;the seventh.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then it shall all be yours,&mdash;a birthday
present.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The young man protested; it was too much.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, you must accept it all,&mdash;equatorial, dome
stand, hut, and everything that has been put here for this
astronomical purpose.&nbsp; The possession of these apparatus
would only compromise me.&nbsp; Already they are reputed to be
yours, and they must be made yours.&nbsp; There is no help for
it.&nbsp; If ever&rsquo; (here her voice lost some
firmness),&mdash;&lsquo;if ever you go away from me,&mdash;from
this place, I mean,&mdash;and marry, and settle in a new home
elsewhere for good, and forget me, you must take these things,
equatorial and all, and never tell your wife or anybody how they
came to be yours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish I could do something more for you!&rsquo;
exclaimed the much-moved astronomer.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you could
but share my fame,&mdash;supposing I get any, which I may die
before doing,&mdash;it would be a little compensation.&nbsp; As
to my going away and marrying, I certainly shall not.&nbsp; I may
go away, but I shall never marry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A beloved science is enough wife for
me,&mdash;combined, perhaps, with a little warm friendship with
one of kindred pursuits.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who is the friend of kindred pursuits?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yourself I should like it to be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You would have to become a woman before I could be
that, publicly; or I a man,&rsquo; she replied, with dry
melancholy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why I a woman, or you a man, dear Lady
Constantine?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot explain.&nbsp; No; you must keep your fame and
your science all to yourself, and I must keep
my&mdash;troubles.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Swithin, to divert her from melancholy&mdash;not knowing that
in the expression of her melancholy thus and now she found much
pleasure,&mdash;changed the subject by asking if they should take
some observations.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; the scenery is well hung to-night,&rsquo; she said
looking out upon the heavens.</p>
<p>Then they proceeded to scan the sky, roving from planet to
star, from single stars to double stars, from double to coloured
stars, in the cursory manner of the merely curious.&nbsp; They
plunged down to that at other times invisible multitude in the
back rows of the celestial theatre: remote layers of
constellations whose shapes were new and singular; pretty
twinklers which for infinite ages had spent their beams without
calling forth from a single earthly poet a single line, or being
able to bestow a ray of comfort on a single benighted
traveller.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And to think,&rsquo; said Lady Constantine, &lsquo;that
the whole race of shepherds, since the beginning of the
world,&mdash;even those immortal shepherds who watched near
Bethlehem,&mdash;should have gone into their graves without
knowing that for one star that lighted them in their labours,
there were a hundred as good behind trying to do so! . . .&nbsp;
I have a feeling for this instrument not unlike the awe I should
feel in the presence of a great magician in whom I really
believed.&nbsp; Its powers are so enormous, and weird, and
fantastical, that I should have a personal fear in being with it
alone.&nbsp; Music drew an angel down, said the poet: but what is
that to drawing down worlds!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I often experience a kind of fear of the sky after
sitting in the observing-chair a long time,&rsquo; he
answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;And when I walk home afterwards I also
fear it, for what I know is there, but cannot see, as one
naturally fears the presence of a vast formless something that
only reveals a very little of itself.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s partly
what I meant by saying that magnitude, which up to a certain
point has grandeur, has beyond it ghastliness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thus the interest of their sidereal observations led them on,
till the knowledge that scarce any other human vision was
travelling within a hundred million miles of their own gave them
such a sense of the isolation of that faculty as almost to be a
sense of isolation in respect of their whole personality, causing
a shudder at its absoluteness.&nbsp; At night, when human
discords and harmonies are hushed, in a general sense, for the
greater part of twelve hours, there is nothing to moderate the
blow with which the infinitely great, the stellar universe,
strikes down upon the infinitely little, the mind of the
beholder; and this was the case now.&nbsp; Having got closer to
immensity than their fellow-creatures, they saw at once its
beauty and its frightfulness.&nbsp; They more and more felt the
contrast between their own tiny magnitudes and those among which
they had recklessly plunged, till they were oppressed with the
presence of a vastness they could not cope with even as an idea,
and which hung about them like a nightmare.</p>
<p>He stood by her while she observed; she by him when they
changed places.&nbsp; Once that Swithin&rsquo;s emancipation from
a trammelling body had been effected by the telescope, and he was
well away in space, she felt her influence over him diminishing
to nothing.&nbsp; He was quite unconscious of his terrestrial
neighbourings, and of herself as one of them.&nbsp; It still
further reduced her towards unvarnished simplicity in her manner
to him.</p>
<p>The silence was broken only by the ticking of the clock-work
which gave diurnal motion to the instrument.&nbsp; The stars
moved on, the end of the telescope followed, but their tongues
stood still.&nbsp; To expect that he was ever voluntarily going
to end the pause by speech was apparently futile.&nbsp; She laid
her hand upon his arm.</p>
<p>He started, withdrew his eye from the telescope, and brought
himself back to the earth by a visible&mdash;almost
painful&mdash;effort.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do come out of it,&rsquo; she coaxed, with a softness
in her voice which any man but unpractised Swithin would have
felt to be exquisite.&nbsp; &lsquo;I feel that I have been so
foolish as to put in your hands an instrument to effect my own
annihilation.&nbsp; Not a word have you spoken for the last ten
minutes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have been mentally getting on with my great
theory.&nbsp; I hope soon to be able to publish it to the
world.&nbsp; What, are you going?&nbsp; I will walk with you,
Lady Constantine.&nbsp; When will you come again?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When your great theory is published to the
world.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>IX</h3>
<p>Lady Constantine, if narrowly observed at this time, would
have seemed to be deeply troubled in conscience, and particularly
after the interview above described.&nbsp; Ash Wednesday occurred
in the calendar a few days later, and she went to morning service
with a look of genuine contrition on her emotional and yearning
countenance.</p>
<p>Besides herself the congregation consisted only of the parson,
clerk, school-children, and three old people living on alms, who
sat under the reading-desk; and thus, when Mr. Torkingham blazed
forth the denunciatory sentences of the Commination, nearly the
whole force of them seemed to descend upon her own
shoulders.&nbsp; Looking across the empty pews she saw through
the one or two clear panes of the window opposite a youthful
figure in the churchyard, and the very feeling against which she
had tried to pray returned again irresistibly.</p>
<p>When she came out and had crossed into the private walk,
Swithin came forward to speak to her.&nbsp; This was a most
unusual circumstance, and argued a matter of importance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have made an amazing discovery in connexion with the
variable stars,&rsquo; he exclaimed.&nbsp; &lsquo;It will excite
the whole astronomical world, and the world outside but little
less.&nbsp; I had long suspected the true secret of their
variability; but it was by the merest chance on earth that I hit
upon a proof of my guess.&nbsp; Your equatorial has done it, my
good, kind Lady Constantine, and our fame is established for
ever!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He sprang into the air, and waved his hat in his triumph.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I am so glad&mdash;so rejoiced!&rsquo; she
cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;What is it?&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t stop to
tell me.&nbsp; Publish it at once in some paper; nail your name
to it, or somebody will seize the idea and appropriate
it,&mdash;forestall you in some way.&nbsp; It will be Adams and
Leverrier over again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I may walk with you I will explain the nature of the
discovery.&nbsp; It accounts for the occasional green tint of
Castor, and every difficulty.&nbsp; I said I would be the
Copernicus of the stellar system, and I have begun to be.&nbsp;
Yet who knows?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now don&rsquo;t be so up and down!&nbsp; I shall not
understand your explanation, and I would rather not know
it.&nbsp; I shall reveal it if it is very grand.&nbsp; Women, you
know, are not safe depositaries of such valuable secrets.&nbsp;
You may walk with me a little way, with great pleasure.&nbsp;
Then go and write your account, so as to insure your ownership of
the discovery. . . .&nbsp; But how you have watched!&rsquo; she
cried, in a sudden accession of anxiety, as she turned to look
more closely at him.&nbsp; &lsquo;The orbits of your eyes are
leaden, and your eyelids are red and heavy.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t do
it&mdash;pray don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; You will be ill, and break
down.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have, it is true, been up a little late this last
week,&rsquo; he said cheerfully.&nbsp; &lsquo;In fact, I
couldn&rsquo;t tear myself away from the equatorial; it is such a
wonderful possession that it keeps me there till daylight.&nbsp;
But what does that matter, now I have made the
discovery?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, it <i>does</i> matter!&nbsp; Now, promise
me&mdash;I insist&mdash;that you will not commit such imprudences
again; for what should I do if my Astronomer Royal were to
die?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She laughed, but far too apprehensively to be effective as a
display of levity.</p>
<p>They parted, and he went home to write out his paper.&nbsp; He
promised to call as soon as his discovery was in print.&nbsp;
Then they waited for the result.</p>
<p>It is impossible to describe the tremulous state of Lady
Constantine during the interval.&nbsp; The warm interest she took
in Swithin St. Cleeve&mdash;many would have said dangerously warm
interest&mdash;made his hopes her hopes; and though she sometimes
admitted to herself that great allowance was requisite for the
overweening confidence of youth in the future, she permitted
herself to be blinded to probabilities for the pleasure of
sharing his dreams.&nbsp; It seemed not unreasonable to suppose
the present hour to be the beginning of realization to her
darling wish that this young man should become famous.&nbsp; He
had worked hard, and why should he not be famous early?&nbsp; His
very simplicity in mundane affairs afforded a strong presumption
that in things celestial he might be wise.&nbsp; To obtain
support for this hypothesis she had only to think over the lives
of many eminent astronomers.</p>
<p>She waited feverishly for the flourish of trumpets from afar,
by which she expected the announcement of his discovery to be
greeted.&nbsp; Knowing that immediate intelligence of the
outburst would be brought to her by himself, she watched from the
windows of the Great House each morning for a sight of his figure
hastening down the glade.</p>
<p>But he did not come.</p>
<p>A long array of wet days passed their dreary shapes before
her, and made the waiting still more tedious.&nbsp; On one of
these occasions she ran across to the tower, at the risk of a
severe cold.&nbsp; The door was locked.</p>
<p>Two days after she went again.&nbsp; The door was locked
still.&nbsp; But this was only to be expected in such
weather.&nbsp; Yet she would have gone on to his house, had there
not been one reason too many against such precipitancy.&nbsp; As
astronomer and astronomer there was no harm in their meetings;
but as woman and man she feared them.</p>
<p>Ten days passed without a sight of him; ten blurred and dreary
days, during which the whole landscape dripped like a mop; the
park trees swabbed the gravel from the drive, while the sky was a
zinc-coloured archi-vault of immovable cloud.&nbsp; It seemed as
if the whole science of astronomy had never been real, and that
the heavenly bodies, with their motions, were as theoretical as
the lines and circles of a bygone mathematical problem.</p>
<p>She could content herself no longer with fruitless visits to
the column, and when the rain had a little abated she walked to
the nearest hamlet, and in a conversation with the first old
woman she met contrived to lead up to the subject of Swithin St.
Cleeve by talking about his grandmother.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, poor old heart; &rsquo;tis a bad time for her, my
lady!&rsquo; exclaimed the dame.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Her grandson is dying; and such a gentleman through and
through!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What! . . .&nbsp; Oh, it has something to do with that
dreadful discovery!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Discovery, my lady?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She left the old woman with an evasive answer, and with a
breaking heart crept along the road.&nbsp; Tears brimmed into her
eyes as she walked, and by the time that she was out of sight
sobs burst forth tumultuously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am too fond of him!&rsquo; she moaned; &lsquo;but I
can&rsquo;t help it; and I don&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s
wrong,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t care!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Without further considerations as to who beheld her doings she
instinctively went straight towards Mrs. Martin&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
Seeing a man coming she calmed herself sufficiently to ask him
through her dropped veil how poor Mr. St. Cleeve was that
day.&nbsp; But she only got the same reply: &lsquo;They say he is
dying, my lady.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When Swithin had parted from Lady Constantine, on the previous
Ash-Wednesday, he had gone straight to the homestead and prepared
his account of &lsquo;A New Astronomical Discovery.&rsquo;&nbsp;
It was written perhaps in too glowing a rhetoric for the true
scientific tone of mind; but there was no doubt that his
assertion met with a most startling aptness all the difficulties
which had accompanied the received theories on the phenomena
attending those changeable suns of marvellous systems so far
away.&nbsp; It accounted for the nebulous mist that surrounds
some of them at their weakest time; in short, took up a position
of probability which has never yet been successfully
assailed.</p>
<p>The papers were written in triplicate, and carefully sealed up
with blue wax.&nbsp; One copy was directed to Greenwich, another
to the Royal Society, another to a prominent astronomer.&nbsp; A
brief statement of the essence of the discovery was also prepared
for the leading daily paper.</p>
<p>He considered these documents, embodying as they did two years
of his constant thought, reading, and observation, too important
to be entrusted for posting to the hands of a messenger; too
important to be sent to the sub-post-office at hand.&nbsp; Though
the day was wet, dripping wet, he went on foot with them to a
chief office, five miles off, and registered them.&nbsp; Quite
exhausted by the walk, after his long night-work, wet through,
yet sustained by the sense of a great achievement, he called at a
bookseller&rsquo;s for the astronomical periodicals to which he
subscribed; then, resting for a short time at an inn, he plodded
his way homewards, reading his papers as he went, and planning
how to enjoy a repose on his laurels of a week or more.</p>
<p>On he strolled through the rain, holding the umbrella
vertically over the exposed page to keep it dry while he
read.&nbsp; Suddenly his eye was struck by an article.&nbsp; It
was the review of a pamphlet by an American astronomer, in which
the author announced a conclusive discovery with regard to
variable stars.</p>
<p>The discovery was precisely the discovery of Swithin St.
Cleeve.&nbsp; Another man had forestalled his fame by a period of
about six weeks.</p>
<p>Then the youth found that the goddess Philosophy, to whom he
had vowed to dedicate his whole life, would not in return support
him through a single hour of despair.&nbsp; In truth, the
impishness of circumstance was newer to him than it would have
been to a philosopher of threescore-and-ten.&nbsp; In a wild wish
for annihilation he flung himself down on a patch of heather that
lay a little removed from the road, and in this humid bed
remained motionless, while time passed by unheeded.</p>
<p>At last, from sheer misery and weariness, he fell asleep.</p>
<p>The March rain pelted him mercilessly, the beaded moisture
from the heavily charged locks of heath penetrated him through
back and sides, and clotted his hair to unsightly tags and
tufts.&nbsp; When he awoke it was dark.&nbsp; He thought of his
grandmother, and of her possible alarm at missing him.&nbsp; On
attempting to rise, he found that he could hardly bend his
joints, and that his clothes were as heavy as lead from
saturation.&nbsp; His teeth chattering and his knees trembling he
pursued his way home, where his appearance excited great
concern.&nbsp; He was obliged at once to retire to bed, and the
next day he was delirious from the chill.</p>
<p>It was about ten days after this unhappy occurrence that Lady
Constantine learnt the news, as above described, and hastened
along to the homestead in that state of anguish in which the
heart is no longer under the control of the judgment, and
self-abandonment even to error, verges on heroism.</p>
<p>On reaching the house in Welland Bottom the door was opened to
her by old Hannah, who wore an assiduously sorrowful look; and
Lady Constantine was shown into the large room,&mdash;so wide
that the beams bent in the middle,&mdash;where she took her seat
in one of a methodic range of chairs, beneath a portrait of the
Reverend Mr. St. Cleeve, her astronomer&rsquo;s erratic
father.</p>
<p>The eight unwatered dying plants, in the row of eight
flower-pots, denoted that there was something wrong in the
house.&nbsp; Mrs. Martin came downstairs fretting, her wonder at
beholding Lady Constantine not altogether displacing the previous
mood of grief.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a pretty kettle of fish, my lady!&rsquo;
she exclaimed.</p>
<p>Lady Constantine said, &lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; and pointed
inquiringly upward.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is not overhead, my lady,&rsquo; replied
Swithin&rsquo;s grandmother.&nbsp; &lsquo;His bedroom is at the
back of the house.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How is he now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is better, just at this moment; and we are more
hopeful.&nbsp; But he changes so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;May I go up?&nbsp; I know he would like to see
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her presence having been made known to the sufferer, she was
conducted upstairs to Swithin&rsquo;s room.&nbsp; The way thither
was through the large chamber he had used as a study and for the
manufacture of optical instruments.&nbsp; There lay the large
pasteboard telescope, that had been just such a failure as
Crusoe&rsquo;s large boat; there were his diagrams, maps, globes,
and celestial apparatus of various sorts.&nbsp; The absence of
the worker, through illness or death is sufficient to touch the
prosiest workshop and tools with the hues of pathos, and it was
with a swelling bosom that Lady Constantine passed through this
arena of his youthful activities to the little chamber where he
lay.</p>
<p>Old Mrs. Martin sat down by the window, and Lady Constantine
bent over Swithin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t speak to me!&rsquo; she whispered.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It will weaken you; it will excite you.&nbsp; If you do
speak, it must be very softly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She took his hand, and one irrepressible tear fell upon
it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing will excite me now, Lady Constantine,&rsquo; he
said; &lsquo;not even your goodness in coming.&nbsp; My last
excitement was when I lost the battle. . . .&nbsp; Do you know
that my discovery has been forestalled?&nbsp; It is that
that&rsquo;s killing me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you are going to recover; you are better, they
say.&nbsp; Is it so?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think I am, to-day.&nbsp; But who can be
sure?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The poor boy was so upset at finding that his labour
had been thrown away,&rsquo; said his grandmother, &lsquo;that he
lay down in the rain, and chilled his life out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How could you do it?&rsquo; Lady Constantine
whispered.&nbsp; &lsquo;O, how could you think so much of renown,
and so little of me?&nbsp; Why, for every discovery made there
are ten behind that await making.&nbsp; To commit suicide like
this, as if there were nobody in the world to care for
you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was done in my haste, and I am very, very sorry for
it!&nbsp; I beg both you and all my few friends never, never to
forgive me!&nbsp; It would kill me with self-reproach if you were
to pardon my rashness!&rsquo;</p>
<p>At this moment the doctor was announced, and Mrs. Martin went
downstairs to receive him.&nbsp; Lady Constantine thought she
would remain to hear his report, and for this purpose withdrew,
and sat down in a nook of the adjoining work-room of Swithin, the
doctor meeting her as he passed through it into the sick
chamber.</p>
<p>He was there a torturingly long time; but at length he came
out to the room she waited in, and crossed it on his way
downstairs.&nbsp; She rose and followed him to the stairhead.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How is he?&rsquo; she anxiously asked.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Will he get over it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The doctor, not knowing the depth of her interest in the
patient, spoke with the blunt candour natural towards a
comparatively indifferent inquirer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Lady Constantine,&rsquo; he replied;
&lsquo;there&rsquo;s a change for the worse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And he retired down the stairs.</p>
<p>Scarcely knowing what she did Lady Constantine ran back to
Swithin&rsquo;s side, flung herself upon the bed and in a
paroxysm of sorrow kissed him.</p>
<h3>X</h3>
<p>The placid inhabitants of the parish of Welland, including
warbling waggoners, lone shepherds, ploughmen, the blacksmith,
the carpenter, the gardener at the Great House, the steward and
agent, the parson, clerk, and so on, were hourly expecting the
announcement of St. Cleeve&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; The sexton had
been going to see his brother-in-law, nine miles distant, but
promptly postponed the visit for a few days, that there might be
the regular professional hand present to toll the bell in a note
of due fulness and solemnity; an attempt by a deputy, on a
previous occasion of his absence, having degenerated into a
miserable stammering clang that was a disgrace to the parish.</p>
<p>But Swithin St. Cleeve did not decease, a fact of which,
indeed, the habituated reader will have been well aware ever
since the rain came down upon the young man in the ninth chapter,
and led to his alarming illness.&nbsp; Though, for that matter,
so many maimed histories are hourly enacting themselves in this
dun-coloured world as to lend almost a priority of interest to
narratives concerning those</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Who lay great bases for eternity<br />
Which prove more short than waste or ruining.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How it arose that he did not die was in this wise; and his
example affords another instance of that reflex rule of the
vassal soul over the sovereign body, which, operating so
wonderfully in elastic natures, and more or less in all,
originally gave rise to the legend that supremacy lay on the
other side.</p>
<p>The evening of the day after the tender, despairing, farewell
kiss of Lady Constantine, when he was a little less weak than
during her visit, he lay with his face to the window.&nbsp; He
lay alone, quiet and resigned.&nbsp; He had been thinking,
sometimes of her and other friends, but chiefly of his lost
discovery.&nbsp; Although nearly unconscious at the time, he had
yet been aware of that kiss, as the delicate flush which followed
it upon his cheek would have told; but he had attached little
importance to it as between woman and man.&nbsp; Had he been
dying of love instead of wet weather, perhaps the impulsive act
of that handsome lady would have been seized on as a proof that
his love was returned.&nbsp; As it was her kiss seemed but the
evidence of a naturally demonstrative kindliness, felt towards
him chiefly because he was believed to be leaving her for
ever.</p>
<p>The reds of sunset passed, and dusk drew on.&nbsp; Old Hannah
came upstairs to pull down the blinds and as she advanced to the
window he said to her, in a faint voice, &lsquo;Well, Hannah,
what news to-day?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, nothing, sir,&rsquo; Hannah replied, looking out of
the window with sad apathy, &lsquo;only that there&rsquo;s a
comet, they say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A <span class="smcap">what</span>?&rsquo; said the
dying astronomer, starting up on his elbow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A comet&mdash;that&rsquo;s all, Master Swithin,&rsquo;
repeated Hannah, in a lower voice, fearing she had done harm in
some way.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, tell me, tell me!&rsquo; cried Swithin.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Is it Gambart&rsquo;s?&nbsp; Is it Charles the
Fifth&rsquo;s, or Halley&rsquo;s, or Faye&rsquo;s, or
whose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; said she, thinking St. Cleeve slightly
delirious again.&nbsp; &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis God
A&rsquo;mighty&rsquo;s, of course.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t seed en
myself, but they say he&rsquo;s getting bigger every night, and
that he&rsquo;ll be the biggest one known for fifty years when
he&rsquo;s full growed.&nbsp; There, you must not talk any more
now, or I&rsquo;ll go away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here was an amazing event, little noise as it had made in the
happening.&nbsp; Of all phenomena that he had longed to witness
during his short astronomical career, those appertaining to
comets had excited him most.&nbsp; That the magnificent comet of
1811 would not return again for thirty centuries had been quite a
permanent regret with him.&nbsp; And now, when the bottomless
abyss of death seemed yawning beneath his feet, one of these
much-desired apparitions, as large, apparently, as any of its
tribe, had chosen to show itself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, if I could but live to see that comet through my
equatorial!&rsquo; he cried.</p>
<p>Compared with comets, variable stars, which he had hitherto
made his study, were, from their remoteness, uninteresting.&nbsp;
They were to the former as the celebrities of Ujiji or Unyamwesi
to the celebrities of his own country.&nbsp; Members of the solar
system, these dazzling and perplexing rangers, the fascination of
all astronomers, rendered themselves still more fascinating by
the sinister suspicion attaching to them of being possibly the
ultimate destroyers of the human race.&nbsp; In his physical
prostration St. Cleeve wept bitterly at not being hale and strong
enough to welcome with proper honour the present specimen of
these desirable visitors.</p>
<p>The strenuous wish to live and behold the new phenomenon,
supplanting the utter weariness of existence that he had
heretofore experienced, gave him a new vitality.&nbsp; The crisis
passed; there was a turn for the better; and after that he
rapidly mended.&nbsp; The comet had in all probability saved his
life.&nbsp; The limitless and complex wonders of the sky resumed
their old power over his imagination; the possibilities of that
unfathomable blue ocean were endless.&nbsp; Finer feats than ever
he would perform were to be achieved in its investigation.&nbsp;
What Lady Constantine had said, that for one discovery made ten
awaited making, was strikingly verified by the sudden appearance
of this splendid marvel.</p>
<p>The windows of St. Cleeve&rsquo;s bedroom faced the west, and
nothing would satisfy him but that his bed should be so pulled
round as to give him a view of the low sky, in which the as yet
minute tadpole of fire was recognizable.&nbsp; The mere sight of
it seemed to lend him sufficient resolution to complete his own
cure forthwith.&nbsp; His only fear now was lest, from some
unexpected cause or other, the comet would vanish before he could
get to the observatory on Rings-Hill Speer.</p>
<p>In his fervour to begin observing he directed that an old
telescope, which he had used in his first celestial attempts,
should be tied at one end to the bed-post, and at the other fixed
near his eye as he reclined.&nbsp; Equipped only with this rough
improvisation he began to take notes.&nbsp; Lady Constantine was
forgotten, till one day, suddenly, wondering if she knew of the
important phenomenon, he revolved in his mind whether as a
fellow-student and sincere friend of his she ought not to be sent
for, and instructed in the use of the equatorial.</p>
<p>But though the image of Lady Constantine, in spite of her
kindness and unmistakably warm heart, had been obscured in his
mind by the heavenly body, she had not so readily forgotten
him.&nbsp; Too shy to repeat her visit after so nearly betraying
her secret, she yet, every day, by the most ingenious and subtle
means that could be devised by a woman who feared for herself,
but could not refrain from tampering with danger, ascertained the
state of her young friend&rsquo;s health.&nbsp; On hearing of the
turn in his condition she rejoiced on his account, and became yet
more despondent on her own.&nbsp; If he had died she might have
mused on him as her dear departed saint without much sin: but his
return to life was a delight that bewildered and dismayed.</p>
<p>One evening a little later on he was sitting at his bedroom
window as usual, waiting for a sufficient decline of light to
reveal the comet&rsquo;s form, when he beheld, crossing the field
contiguous to the house, a figure which he knew to be hers.&nbsp;
He thought she must be coming to see him on the great comet
question, to discuss which with so delightful and kind a comrade
was an expectation full of pleasure.&nbsp; Hence he keenly
observed her approach, till something happened that surprised
him.</p>
<p>When, at the descent of the hill, she had reached the stile
that admitted to Mrs. Martin&rsquo;s garden, Lady Constantine
stood quite still for a minute or more, her gaze bent on the
ground.&nbsp; Instead of coming on to the house she went heavily
and slowly back, almost as if in pain; and then at length,
quickening her pace, she was soon out of sight.&nbsp; She
appeared in the path no more that day.</p>
<h3>XI</h3>
<p>Why had Lady Constantine stopped and turned?</p>
<p>A misgiving had taken sudden possession of her.&nbsp; Her true
sentiment towards St. Cleeve was too recognizable by herself to
be tolerated.</p>
<p>That she had a legitimate interest in him as a young
astronomer was true; that her sympathy on account of his severe
illness had been natural and commendable was also true.&nbsp; But
the superfluous feeling was what filled her with trepidation.</p>
<p>Superfluities have been defined as things you cannot do
without, and this particular emotion, that came not within her
rightful measure, was in danger of becoming just such a
superfluity with her.&nbsp; In short, she felt there and then
that to see St. Cleeve again would be an impropriety; and by a
violent effort she retreated from his precincts, as he had
observed.</p>
<p>She resolved to ennoble her conduct from that moment of her
life onwards.&nbsp; She would exercise kind patronage towards
Swithin without once indulging herself with his company.&nbsp;
Inexpressibly dear to her deserted heart he was becoming, but for
the future he should at least be hidden from her eyes.&nbsp; To
speak plainly, it was growing a serious question whether, if he
were not hidden from her eyes, she would not soon be plunging
across the ragged boundary which divides the permissible from the
forbidden.</p>
<p>By the time that she had drawn near home the sun was going
down.&nbsp; The heavy, many-chevroned church, now subdued by
violet shadow except where its upper courses caught the western
stroke of flame-colour, stood close to her grounds, as in many
other parishes, though the village of which it formerly was the
nucleus had become quite depopulated: its cottages had been
demolished to enlarge the park, leaving the old building to stand
there alone, like a standard without an army.</p>
<p>It was Friday night, and she heard the organist practising
voluntaries within.&nbsp; The hour, the notes, the even-song of
the birds, and her own previous emotions, combined to influence
her devotionally.&nbsp; She entered, turning to the right and
passing under the chancel arch, where she sat down and viewed the
whole empty length, east and west.&nbsp; The semi-Norman arches
of the nave, with their multitudinous notchings, were still
visible by the light from the tower window, but the lower portion
of the building was in obscurity, except where the feeble glimmer
from the candle of the organist spread a glow-worm radiance
around.&nbsp; The player, who was Miss Tabitha Lark, continued
without intermission to produce her wandering sounds, unconscious
of any one&rsquo;s presence except that of the youthful blower at
her side.</p>
<p>The rays from the organist&rsquo;s candle illuminated but one
small fragment of the chancel outside the precincts of the
instrument, and that was the portion of the eastern wall whereon
the ten commandments were inscribed.&nbsp; The gilt letters shone
sternly into Lady Constantine&rsquo;s eyes; and she, being as
impressionable as a turtle-dove, watched a certain one of those
commandments on the second table, till its thunder broke her
spirit with blank contrition.</p>
<p>She knelt down, and did her utmost to eradicate those impulses
towards St. Cleeve which were inconsistent with her position as
the wife of an absent man, though not unnatural in her as his
victim.</p>
<p>She knelt till she seemed scarcely to belong to the time she
lived in, which lost the magnitude that the nearness of its
perspective lent it on ordinary occasions, and took its actual
rank in the long line of other centuries.&nbsp; Having once got
out of herself, seen herself from afar off, she was calmer, and
went on to register a magnanimous vow.&nbsp; She would look about
for some maiden fit and likely to make St. Cleeve happy; and this
girl she would endow with what money she could afford, that the
natural result of their apposition should do him no worldly
harm.&nbsp; The interest of her, Lady Constantine&rsquo;s, life
should be in watching the development of love between Swithin and
the ideal maiden.&nbsp; The very painfulness of the scheme to her
susceptible heart made it pleasing to her conscience; and she
wondered that she had not before this time thought of a stratagem
which united the possibility of benefiting the astronomer with
the advantage of guarding against peril to both Swithin and
herself.&nbsp; By providing for him a suitable helpmate she would
preclude the dangerous awakening in him of sentiments
reciprocating her own.</p>
<p>Arrived at a point of exquisite misery through this heroic
intention, Lady Constantine&rsquo;s tears moistened the books
upon which her forehead was bowed.&nbsp; And as she heard her
feverish heart throb against the desk, she firmly believed the
wearing impulses of that heart would put an end to her sad life,
and momentarily recalled the banished image of St. Cleeve to
apostrophise him in thoughts that paraphrased the quaint lines of
Heine&rsquo;s <i>Lieb&rsquo; Liebchen</i>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Dear my love, press thy hand to my breast,
and tell<br />
If thou tracest the knocks in that narrow cell;<br />
A carpenter dwells there; cunning is he,<br />
And slyly he&rsquo;s shaping a coffin for me!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lady Constantine was disturbed by a break in the
organist&rsquo;s meandering practice, and raising her head she
saw a person standing by the player.&nbsp; It was Mr. Torkingham,
and what he said was distinctly audible.&nbsp; He was inquiring
for herself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought I saw Lady Constantine walk this way,&rsquo;
he rejoined to Tabitha&rsquo;s negative.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am very
anxious indeed to meet with her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She went forward.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am here,&rsquo; she
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t stop playing, Miss Lark.&nbsp;
What is it, Mr. Torkingham?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Tabitha thereupon resumed her playing, and Mr. Torkingham
joined Lady Constantine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have some very serious intelligence to break to your
ladyship,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;But&mdash;I will not
interrupt you here.&rsquo;&nbsp; (He had seen her rise from her
knees to come to him.)&nbsp; &lsquo;I will call at the House the
first moment you can receive me after reaching home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, tell me here,&rsquo; she said, seating herself.</p>
<p>He came close, and placed his hand on the poppy-head of the
seat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have received a communication,&rsquo; he resumed
haltingly, &lsquo;in which I am requested to prepare you for the
contents of a letter that you will receive to-morrow
morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am quite ready.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The subject is briefly this, Lady Constantine: that you
have been a widow for more than eighteen months.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dead!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; Sir Blount was attacked by dysentery and
malarious fever, on the banks of the Zouga in South Africa, so
long ago as last October twelvemonths, and it carried him
off.&nbsp; Of the three men who were with him, two succumbed to
the same illness, a hundred miles further on; while the third,
retracing his steps into a healthier district, remained there
with a native tribe, and took no pains to make the circumstances
known.&nbsp; It seems to be only by the mere accident of his
having told some third party that we know of the matter
now.&nbsp; This is all I can tell you at present.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She was greatly agitated for a few moments; and the Table of
the Law opposite, which now seemed to appertain to another
dispensation, glistened indistinctly upon a vision still obscured
by the old tears.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shall I conduct you home?&rsquo; asked the parson.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No thank you,&rsquo; said Lady Constantine.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I would rather go alone.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>XII</h3>
<p>On the afternoon of the next day Mr. Torkingham, who
occasionally dropped in to see St. Cleeve, called again as usual;
after duly remarking on the state of the weather, congratulating
him on his sure though slow improvement, and answering his
inquiries about the comet, he said, &lsquo;You have heard, I
suppose, of what has happened to Lady Constantine?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No!&nbsp; Nothing serious?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, it is serious.&rsquo;&nbsp; The parson informed
him of the death of Sir Blount, and of the accidents which had
hindered all knowledge of the same,&mdash;accidents favoured by
the estrangement of the pair and the cessation of correspondence
between them for some time.</p>
<p>His listener received the news with the concern of a friend,
Lady Constantine&rsquo;s aspect in his eyes depending but little
on her condition matrimonially.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There was no attempt to bring him home when he
died?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no.&nbsp; The climate necessitates instant
burial.&nbsp; We shall have more particulars in a day or two,
doubtless.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor Lady Constantine,&mdash;so good and so sensitive
as she is!&nbsp; I suppose she is quite prostrated by the bad
news.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, she is rather serious,&mdash;not
prostrated.&nbsp; The household is going into
mourning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, no, she would not be quite prostrated,&rsquo;
murmured Swithin, recollecting himself.&nbsp; &lsquo;He was
unkind to her in many ways.&nbsp; Do you think she will go away
from Welland?&rsquo;</p>
<p>That the vicar could not tell.&nbsp; But he feared that Sir
Blount&rsquo;s affairs had been in a seriously involved
condition, which might necessitate many and unexpected
changes.</p>
<p>Time showed that Mr. Torkingham&rsquo;s surmises were
correct.</p>
<p>During the long weeks of early summer, through which the young
man still lay imprisoned, if not within his own chamber, within
the limits of the house and garden, news reached him that Sir
Blount&rsquo;s mismanagement and eccentric behaviour were
resulting in serious consequences to Lady Constantine; nothing
less, indeed, than her almost complete impoverishment.&nbsp; His
personalty was swallowed up in paying his debts, and the Welland
estate was so heavily charged with annuities to his distant
relatives that only a mere pittance was left for her.&nbsp; She
was reducing the establishment to the narrowest compass
compatible with decent gentility.&nbsp; The horses were sold one
by one; the carriages also; the greater part of the house was
shut up, and she resided in the smallest rooms.&nbsp; All that
was allowed to remain of her former contingent of male servants
were an odd man and a boy.&nbsp; Instead of using a carriage she
now drove about in a donkey-chair, the said boy walking in front
to clear the way and keep the animal in motion; while she wore,
so his informants reported, not an ordinary widow&rsquo;s cap or
bonnet, but something even plainer, the black material being
drawn tightly round her face, giving her features a small,
demure, devout cast, very pleasing to the eye.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, what&rsquo;s the most curious thing in this, Mr.
San Cleeve,&rsquo; said Sammy Blore, who, in calling to inquire
after Swithin&rsquo;s health, had imparted some of the above
particulars, &lsquo;is that my lady seems not to mind being a
pore woman half so much as we do at seeing her so.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis a wonderful gift, Mr. San Cleeve, wonderful, to be
able to guide yerself, and not let loose yer soul in blasting at
such a misfortune.&nbsp; I should go and drink neat regular, as
soon as I had swallered my breakfast, till my innerds was burnt
out like a&rsquo; old copper, if it had happened to me; but my
lady&rsquo;s plan is best.&nbsp; Though I only guess how one
feels in such losses, to be sure, for I never had nothing to
lose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile the observatory was not forgotten; nor that visitant
of singular shape and habits which had appeared in the sky from
no one knew whence, trailing its luminous streamer, and
proceeding on its way in the face of a wondering world, till it
should choose to vanish as suddenly as it had come.</p>
<p>When, about a month after the above dialogue took place,
Swithin was allowed to go about as usual, his first pilgrimage
was to the Rings-Hill Speer.&nbsp; Here he studied at leisure
what he had come to see.</p>
<p>On his return to the homestead, just after sunset, he found
his grandmother and Hannah in a state of great concern.&nbsp; The
former was looking out for him against the evening light, her
face showing itself worn and rutted, like an old highway, by the
passing of many days.&nbsp; Her information was that in his
absence Lady Constantine had called in her driving-chair, to
inquire for him.&nbsp; Her ladyship had wished to observe the
comet through the great telescope, but had found the door locked
when she applied at the tower.&nbsp; Would he kindly leave the
door unfastened to-morrow, she had asked, that she might be able
to go to the column on the following evening for the same
purpose?&nbsp; She did not require him to attend.</p>
<p>During the next day he sent Hannah with the key to Welland
House, not caring to leave the tower open.&nbsp; As evening
advanced and the comet grew distinct, he doubted if Lady
Constantine could handle the telescope alone with any pleasure or
profit to herself.&nbsp; Unable, as a devotee to science, to rest
under this misgiving, he crossed the field in the furrow that he
had used ever since the corn was sown, and entered the
plantation.&nbsp; His unpractised mind never once guessed that
her stipulations against his coming might have existed along with
a perverse hope that he would come.</p>
<p>On ascending he found her already there.&nbsp; She sat in the
observing-chair: the warm light from the west, which flowed in
through the opening of the dome, brightened her face, and her
face only, her robes of sable lawn rendering the remainder of her
figure almost invisible.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have come!&rsquo; she said with shy pleasure.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I did not require you.&nbsp; But never mind.&rsquo;&nbsp;
She extended her hand cordially to him.</p>
<p>Before speaking he looked at her with a great new interest in
his eye.&nbsp; It was the first time that he had seen her thus,
and she was altered in more than dress.&nbsp; A soberly-sweet
expression sat on her face.&nbsp; It was of a rare and peculiar
shade&mdash;something that he had never seen before in woman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you nothing to say?&rsquo; she continued.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Your footsteps were audible to me from the very bottom,
and I knew they were yours.&nbsp; You look almost
restored.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am almost restored,&rsquo; he replied, respectfully
pressing her hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;A reason for living arose, and I
lived.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What reason?&rsquo; she inquired, with a rapid
blush.</p>
<p>He pointed to the rocket-like object in the western sky.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, you mean the comet.&nbsp; Well, you will never make
a courtier!&nbsp; You know, of course, what has happened to me;
that I have no longer a husband&mdash;have had none for a year
and a half.&nbsp; Have you also heard that I am now quite a poor
woman?&nbsp; Tell me what you think of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have thought very little of it since I heard that you
seemed to mind poverty but little.&nbsp; There is even this good
in it, that I may now be able to show you some little kindness
for all those you have done me, my dear lady.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Unless for economy&rsquo;s sake, I go and live abroad,
at Dinan, Versailles, or Boulogne.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Swithin, who had never thought of such a contingency, was
earnest in his regrets; without, however, showing more than a
sincere friend&rsquo;s disappointment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not say it was absolutely necessary,&rsquo; she
continued.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have, in fact, grown so homely and
home-loving, I am so interested in the place and the people here,
that, in spite of advice, I have almost determined not to let the
house; but to continue the less business-like but pleasanter
alternative of living humbly in a part of it, and shutting up the
rest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your love of astronomy is getting as strong as
mine!&rsquo; he said ardently.&nbsp; &lsquo;You could not tear
yourself away from the observatory!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You might have supposed me capable of a little human
feeling as well as scientific, in connection with the
observatory.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear Lady Constantine, by admitting that your
astronomer has also a part of your interest&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, you did not find it out without my telling!&rsquo;
she said, with a playfulness which was scarcely playful, a new
accession of pinkness being visible in her face.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
diminish myself in your esteem by reminding you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You might do anything in this world without diminishing
yourself in my esteem, after the goodness you have shown.&nbsp;
And more than that, no misrepresentation, no rumour, no damning
appearance whatever would ever shake my loyalty to
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you put a very matter-of-fact construction on my
motives sometimes.&nbsp; You see me in such a hard light that I
have to drop hints in quite a manoeuvring manner to let you know
I am as sympathetic as other people.&nbsp; I sometimes think you
would rather have me die than have your equatorial stolen.&nbsp;
Confess that your admiration for me was based on my house and
position in the county!&nbsp; Now I am shorn of all that glory,
such as it was, and am a widow, and am poorer than my tenants,
and can no longer buy telescopes, and am unable, from the
narrowness of my circumstances, to mix in circles that people
formerly said I adorned, I fear I have lost the little hold I
once had over you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are as unjust now as you have been generous
hitherto,&rsquo; said St. Cleeve, with tears in his eyes at the
gentle banter of the lady, which he, poor innocent, read as her
real opinions.&nbsp; Seizing her hand he continued, in tones
between reproach and anger, &lsquo;I swear to you that I have but
two devotions, two thoughts, two hopes, and two blessings in this
world, and that one of them is yourself!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And the other?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The pursuit of astronomy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And astronomy stands first.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have never ordinated two such dissimilar ideas.&nbsp;
And why should you deplore your altered circumstances, my dear
lady?&nbsp; Your widowhood, if I may take the liberty to speak on
such a subject, is, though I suppose a sadness, not perhaps an
unmixed evil.&nbsp; For though your pecuniary troubles have been
discovered to the world and yourself by it, your happiness in
marriage was, as you have confided to me, not great; and you are
now left free as a bird to follow your own hobbies.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wonder you recognize that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But perhaps,&rsquo; he added, with a sigh of regret,
&lsquo;you will again fall a prey to some man, some uninteresting
country squire or other, and be lost to the scientific world
after all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I fall a prey to any man, it will not be to a
country squire.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t go on with this, for
heaven&rsquo;s sake!&nbsp; You may think what you like in
silence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are forgetting the comet,&rsquo; said St.
Cleeve.&nbsp; He turned, and set the instrument in order for
observation, and wheeled round the dome.</p>
<p>While she was looking at the nucleus of the fiery plume, that
now filled so large a space of the sky as completely to dominate
it, Swithin dropped his gaze upon the field, and beheld in the
dying light a number of labourers crossing directly towards the
column.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you see?&rsquo; Lady Constantine asked, without
ceasing to observe the comet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some of the work-folk are coming this way.&nbsp; I know
what they are coming for,&mdash;I promised to let them look at
the comet through the glass.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They must not come up here,&rsquo; she said
decisively.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They shall await your time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have a special reason for wishing them not to see me
here.&nbsp; If you ask why, I can tell you.&nbsp; They mistakenly
suspect my interest to be less in astronomy than in the
astronomer, and they must have no showing for such a wild
notion.&nbsp; What can you do to keep them out?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll lock the door,&rsquo; said Swithin.&nbsp;
&lsquo;They will then think I am away.&rsquo;&nbsp; He ran down
the staircase, and she could hear him hastily turning the
key.&nbsp; Lady Constantine sighed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What weakness, what weakness!&rsquo; she said to
herself.&nbsp; &lsquo;That envied power of self-control, where is
it?&nbsp; That power of concealment which a woman should
have&mdash;where?&nbsp; To run such risks, to come here
alone,&mdash;oh, if it were known!&nbsp; But I was always
so,&mdash;always!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She jumped up, and followed him downstairs.</p>
<h3>XIII</h3>
<p>He was standing immediately inside the door at the bottom,
though it was so dark she could hardly see him.&nbsp; The
villagers were audibly talking just without.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s sure to come, rathe or late,&rsquo;
resounded up the spiral in the vocal note of Hezzy Biles.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t let such a fine show as the comet makes
to-night go by without peeping at it,&mdash;not Master
Cleeve!&nbsp; Did ye bring along the flagon, Haymoss?&nbsp; Then
we&rsquo;ll sit down inside his little board-house here, and
wait.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll come afore bed-time.&nbsp; Why, his
spy-glass will stretch out that there comet as long as Welland
Lane!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;d as soon miss the great peep-show that comes
every year to Greenhill Fair as a sight of such a immortal
spectacle as this!&rsquo; said Amos Fry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Immortal spectacle,&rdquo;&mdash;where did ye
get that choice mossel, Haymoss?&rsquo; inquired Sammy
Blore.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, well, the Lord save good
scholars&mdash;and take just a bit o&rsquo; care of them that
bain&rsquo;t!&nbsp; As &rsquo;tis so dark in the hut, suppose we
draw out the bench into the front here, souls?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The bench was accordingly brought forth, and in order to have
a back to lean against, they placed it exactly across the door
into the spiral staircase.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, have ye got any backy?&nbsp; If ye haven&rsquo;t,
I have,&rsquo; continued Sammy Blore.&nbsp; A striking of matches
followed, and the speaker concluded comfortably, &lsquo;Now we
shall do very well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what do this comet mean?&rsquo; asked
Haymoss.&nbsp; &lsquo;That some great tumult is going to happen,
or that we shall die of a famine?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Famine&mdash;no!&rsquo; said Nat Chapman.&nbsp;
&lsquo;That only touches such as we, and the Lord only consarns
himself with born gentlemen.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t to be supposed
that a strange fiery lantern like that would be lighted up for
folks with ten or a dozen shillings a week and their gristing,
and a load o&rsquo; thorn faggots when we can get
&rsquo;em.&nbsp; If &rsquo;tis a token that he&rsquo;s getting
hot about the ways of anybody in this parish, &rsquo;tis about my
Lady Constantine&rsquo;s, since she is the only one of a figure
worth such a hint.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As for her income,&mdash;that she&rsquo;s now
lost.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, well; I don&rsquo;t take in all I hear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lady Constantine drew close to St. Cleeve&rsquo;s side, and
whispered, trembling, &lsquo;Do you think they will wait
long?&nbsp; Or can we get out?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Swithin felt the awkwardness of the situation.&nbsp; The men
had placed the bench close to the door, which, owing to the
stairs within, opened outwards; so that at the first push by the
pair inside to release themselves the bench must have gone over,
and sent the smokers sprawling on their faces.&nbsp; He whispered
to her to ascend the column and wait till he came.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And have the dead man left her nothing?&nbsp;
Hey?&nbsp; And have he carried his inheritance into&rsquo;s
grave?&nbsp; And will his skeleton lie warm on account
o&rsquo;t?&nbsp; Hee-hee!&rsquo; said Haymoss.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis all swallered up,&rsquo; observed Hezzy
Biles.&nbsp; &lsquo;His goings-on made her miserable till
&rsquo;a died, and if I were the woman I&rsquo;d have my randys
now.&nbsp; He ought to have bequeathed to her our young gent, Mr.
St. Cleeve, as some sort of amends.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d up and marry
en, if I were she; since her downfall has brought &rsquo;em quite
near together, and made him as good as she in rank, as he was
afore in bone and breeding.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;D&rsquo;ye think she will?&rsquo; asked Sammy
Blore.&nbsp; &lsquo;Or is she meaning to enter upon a virgin life
for the rest of her days?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be unreverent to her ladyship;
but I really don&rsquo;t think she is meaning any such waste of a
Christian carcase.&nbsp; I say she&rsquo;s rather meaning to
commit flat matrimony wi&rsquo; somebody or other, and one young
gentleman in particular.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But the young man himself?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Planned, cut out, and finished for the delight of
&rsquo;ooman!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yet he must be willing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That would soon come.&nbsp; If they get up this tower
ruling plannards together much longer, their plannards will soon
rule them together, in my way o&rsquo; thinking.&nbsp; If
she&rsquo;ve a disposition towards the knot, she can soon teach
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;True, true, and lawfully.&nbsp; What before mid
ha&rsquo; been a wrong desire is now a holy wish!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The scales fell from Swithin St. Cleeve&rsquo;s eyes as he
heard the words of his neighbours.&nbsp; How suddenly the truth
dawned upon him; how it bewildered him, till he scarcely knew
where he was; how he recalled the full force of what he had only
half apprehended at earlier times, particularly of that sweet
kiss she had impressed on his lips when she supposed him
dying,&mdash;these vivid realizations are difficult to tell in
slow verbiage.&nbsp; He could remain there no longer, and with an
electrified heart he retreated up the spiral.</p>
<p>He found Lady Constantine half way to the top, standing by a
loop-hole; and when she spoke he discovered that she was almost
in tears.&nbsp; &lsquo;Are they gone?&rsquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I fear they will not go yet,&rsquo; he replied, with a
nervous fluctuation of manner that had never before appeared in
his bearing towards her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What shall I do?&rsquo; she asked.&nbsp; &lsquo;I ought
not to be here; nobody knows that I am out of the house.&nbsp;
Oh, this is a mistake!&nbsp; I must go home somehow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you hear what they were saying?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said she.&nbsp; &lsquo;What is the
matter?&nbsp; Surely you are disturbed?&nbsp; What did they
say?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It would be the exaggeration of frankness in me to tell
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it what a woman ought not to be made acquainted
with?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is, in this case.&nbsp; It is so new and so
indescribable an idea to me&mdash;that&rsquo;&mdash;he leant
against the concave wall, quite tremulous with strange incipient
sentiments.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What sort of an idea?&rsquo; she asked gently.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is&mdash;an awakening.&nbsp; In thinking of the
heaven above, I did not perceive&mdash;the&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Earth beneath?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The better heaven beneath.&nbsp; Pray, dear Lady
Constantine, give me your hand for a moment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She seemed startled, and the hand was not given.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am so anxious to get home,&rsquo; she repeated.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I did not mean to stay here more than five
minutes!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I fear I am much to blame for this accident,&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I ought not to have intruded here.&nbsp; But
don&rsquo;t grieve!&nbsp; I will arrange for your escape,
somehow.&nbsp; Be good enough to follow me down.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They redescended, and, whispering to Lady Constantine to
remain a few stairs behind, he began to rattle and unlock the
door.</p>
<p>The men precipitately removed their bench, and Swithin stepped
out, the light of the summer night being still enough to enable
them to distinguish him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Hezekiah, and Samuel, and Nat, how are
you?&rsquo; he said boldly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, sir, &rsquo;tis much as before wi&rsquo;
me,&rsquo; replied Nat.&nbsp; &lsquo;One hour a week wi&rsquo;
God A&rsquo;mighty and the rest with the devil, as a chap may
say.&nbsp; And really, now yer poor father&rsquo;s gone,
I&rsquo;d as lief that that Sunday hour should pass like the
rest; for Pa&rsquo;son Tarkenham do tease a feller&rsquo;s
conscience that much, that church is no hollerday at all to the
limbs, as it was in yer reverent father&rsquo;s time!&nbsp; But
we&rsquo;ve been waiting here, Mr. San Cleeve, supposing ye had
not come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have been staying at the top, and fastened the door
not to be disturbed.&nbsp; Now I am sorry to disappoint you, but
I have another engagement this evening, so that it would be
inconvenient to admit you.&nbsp; To-morrow evening, or any
evening but this, I will show you the comet and any stars you
like.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They readily agreed to come the next night, and prepared to
depart.&nbsp; But what with the flagon, and the pipes, and the
final observations, getting away was a matter of time.&nbsp;
Meanwhile a cloud, which nobody had noticed, arose from the north
overhead, and large drops of rain began to fall so rapidly that
the conclave entered the hut till it should be over.&nbsp; St.
Cleeve strolled off under the firs.</p>
<p>The next moment there was a rustling through the trees at
another point, and a man and woman appeared.&nbsp; The woman took
shelter under a tree, and the man, bearing wraps and umbrellas,
came forward.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My lady&rsquo;s man and maid,&rsquo; said Sammy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is her ladyship here?&rsquo; asked the man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&nbsp; I reckon her ladyship keeps more kissable
company,&rsquo; replied Nat Chapman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pack o&rsquo; stuff!&rsquo; said Blore.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not here?&nbsp; Well, to be sure!&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t
find her anywhere in the wide house!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been sent
to look for her with these overclothes and umbrella.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve suffered horse-flesh traipsing up and down, and
can&rsquo;t find her nowhere.&nbsp; Lord, Lord, where can she be,
and two months&rsquo; wages owing to me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why so anxious, Anthony Green, as I think yer name is
shaped?&nbsp; You be not a married man?&rsquo; said Hezzy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis what they call me, neighbours, whether or
no.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But surely you was a bachelor chap by late, afore her
ladyship got rid of the regular servants and took ye?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I were; but that&rsquo;s past!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And how came ye to bow yer head to &rsquo;t,
Anthony?&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis what you never was inclined to.&nbsp;
You was by no means a doting man in my time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, had I been left to my own free choice, &rsquo;tis
as like as not I should ha&rsquo; shunned forming such kindred,
being at that time a poor day man, or weekly, at my highest luck
in hiring.&nbsp; But &rsquo;tis wearing work to hold out against
the custom of the country, and the woman wanting ye to stand by
her and save her from unborn shame; so, since common usage would
have it, I let myself be carried away by opinion, and took
her.&nbsp; Though she&rsquo;s never once thanked me for covering
her confusion, that&rsquo;s true!&nbsp; But, &rsquo;tis the way
of the lost when safe, and I don&rsquo;t complain.&nbsp; Here she
is, just behind, under the tree, if you&rsquo;d like to see
her?&mdash;a very nice homespun woman to look at, too, for all
her few weather-stains. . . .&nbsp; Well, well, where can my lady
be?&nbsp; And I the trusty jineral man&mdash;&rsquo;tis more than
my place is worth to lose her!&nbsp; Come forward, Christiana,
and talk nicely to the work-folk.&rsquo;</p>
<p>While the woman was talking the rain increased so much that
they all retreated further into the hut.&nbsp; St. Cleeve, who
had impatiently stood a little way off, now saw his opportunity,
and, putting in his head, said, &lsquo;The rain beats in; you had
better shut the door.&nbsp; I must ascend and close up the
dome.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Slamming the door upon them without ceremony he quickly went
to Lady Constantine in the column, and telling her they could now
pass the villagers unseen he gave her his arm.&nbsp; Thus he
conducted her across the front of the hut into the shadows of the
firs.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will run to the house and harness your little
carriage myself,&rsquo; he said tenderly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I will
then take you home in it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; please don&rsquo;t leave me alone under these
dismal trees!&rsquo;&nbsp; Neither would she hear of his getting
her any wraps; and, opening her little sunshade to keep the rain
out of her face, she walked with him across the insulating field,
after which the trees of the park afforded her a sufficient
shelter to reach home without much damage.</p>
<p>Swithin was too greatly affected by what he had overheard to
speak much to her on the way, and protected her as if she had
been a shorn lamb.&nbsp; After a farewell which had more meaning
than sound in it, he hastened back to Rings-Hill Speer.&nbsp; The
work-folk were still in the hut, and, by dint of friendly
converse and a sip at the flagon, had so cheered Mr. and Mrs.
Anthony Green that they neither thought nor cared what had become
of Lady Constantine.</p>
<p>St. Cleeve&rsquo;s sudden sense of new relations with that
sweet patroness had taken away in one half-hour his natural
ingenuousness.&nbsp; Henceforth he could act a part.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have made all secure at the top,&rsquo; he said,
putting his head into the hut.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am now going
home.&nbsp; When the rain stops, lock this door and bring the key
to my house.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>XIV</h3>
<p>The laboured resistance which Lady Constantine&rsquo;s
judgment had offered to her rebellious affection ere she learnt
that she was a widow, now passed into a bashfulness that rendered
her almost as unstable of mood as before.&nbsp; But she was one
of that mettle&mdash;fervid, cordial, and spontaneous&mdash;who
had not the heart to spoil a passion; and her affairs having gone
to rack and ruin by no fault of her own she was left to a
painfully narrowed existence which lent even something of
rationality to her attachment.&nbsp; Thus it was that her tender
and unambitious soul found comfort in her reverses.</p>
<p>As for St. Cleeve, the tardiness of his awakening was the
natural result of inexperience combined with devotion to a
hobby.&nbsp; But, like a spring bud hard in bursting, the delay
was compensated by after speed.&nbsp; At once breathlessly
recognizing in this fellow-watcher of the skies a woman who loved
him, in addition to the patroness and friend, he truly translated
the nearly forgotten kiss she had given him in her moment of
despair.</p>
<p>Lady Constantine, in being eight or nine years his senior, was
an object even better calculated to nourish a youth&rsquo;s first
passion than a girl of his own age, superiority of experience and
ripeness of emotion exercising the same peculiar fascination over
him as over other young men in their first ventures in this
kind.</p>
<p>The alchemy which thus transmuted an abstracted astronomer
into an eager lover&mdash;and, must it be said, spoilt a
promising young physicist to produce a common-place
inamorato&mdash;may be almost described as working its change in
one short night.&nbsp; Next morning he was so fascinated with the
novel sensation that he wanted to rush off at once to Lady
Constantine, and say, &lsquo;I love you true!&rsquo; in the
intensest tones of his mental condition, to register his
assertion in her heart before any of those accidents which
&rsquo;creep in &rsquo;twixt vows, and change decrees of
kings,&rsquo; should occur to hinder him.&nbsp; But his
embarrassment at standing in a new position towards her would not
allow him to present himself at her door in any such hurry.&nbsp;
He waited on, as helplessly as a girl, for a chance of
encountering her.</p>
<p>But though she had tacitly agreed to see him on any reasonable
occasion, Lady Constantine did not put herself in his way.&nbsp;
She even kept herself out of his way.&nbsp; Now that for the
first time he had learnt to feel a strong impatience for their
meeting, her shyness for the first time led her to delay
it.&nbsp; But given two people living in one parish, who long
from the depths of their hearts to be in each other&rsquo;s
company, what resolves of modesty, policy, pride, or apprehension
will keep them for any length of time apart?</p>
<p>One afternoon he was watching the sun from his tower, half
echoing the Greek astronomer&rsquo;s wish that he might be set
close to that luminary for the wonder of beholding it in all its
glory, under the slight penalty of being consumed the next
instant.&nbsp; He glanced over the high-road between the field
and the park (which sublunary features now too often distracted
his attention from his telescope), and saw her passing along that
way.</p>
<p>She was seated in the donkey-carriage that had now taken the
place of her landau, the white animal looking no larger than a
cat at that distance.&nbsp; The buttoned boy, who represented
both coachman and footman, walked alongside the animal&rsquo;s
head at a solemn pace; the dog stalked at the distance of a yard
behind the vehicle, without indulging in a single gambol; and the
whole turn-out resembled in dignity a dwarfed state
procession.</p>
<p>Here was an opportunity but for two obstructions: the boy, who
might be curious; and the dog, who might bark and attract the
attention of any labourers or servants near.&nbsp; Yet the risk
was to be run, and, knowing that she would soon turn up a certain
shady lane at right angles to the road she had followed, he ran
hastily down the staircase, crossed the barley (which now covered
the field) by the path not more than a foot wide that he had
trodden for himself, and got into the lane at the other
end.&nbsp; By slowly walking along in the direction of the
turnpike-road he soon had the satisfaction of seeing her
coming.&nbsp; To his surprise he also had the satisfaction of
perceiving that neither boy nor dog was in her company.</p>
<p>They both blushed as they approached, she from sex, he from
inexperience.&nbsp; One thing she seemed to see in a moment, that
in the interval of her absence St. Cleeve had become a man; and
as he greeted her with this new and maturer light in his eyes she
could not hide her embarrassment, or meet their fire.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have just sent my page across to the column with your
book on Cometary Nuclei,&rsquo; she said softly; &lsquo;that you
might not have to come to the house for it.&nbsp; I did not know
I should meet you here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t you wish me to come to the house for
it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not, frankly.&nbsp; You know why, do you
not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I know.&nbsp; Well, my longing is at rest.&nbsp; I
have met you again.&nbsp; But are you unwell, that you drive out
in this chair?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; I walked out this morning, and am a little
tired.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have been looking for you night and day.&nbsp; Why do
you turn your face aside?&nbsp; You used not to be
so.&rsquo;&nbsp; Her hand rested on the side of the chair, and he
took it.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you know that since we last met, I have
been thinking of you&mdash;daring to think of you&mdash;as I
never thought of you before?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I know it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How did you know?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I saw it in your face when you came up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I suppose I ought not to think of you so.&nbsp;
And yet, had I not learned to, I should never fully have felt how
gentle and sweet you are.&nbsp; Only think of my loss if I had
lived and died without seeing more in you than in
astronomy!&nbsp; But I shall never leave off doing so now.&nbsp;
When you talk I shall love your understanding; when you are
silent I shall love your face.&nbsp; But how shall I know that
you care to be so much to me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her manner was disturbed as she recognized the impending
self-surrender, which she knew not how to resist, and was not
altogether at ease in welcoming.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, Lady Constantine,&rsquo; he continued, bending over
her, &lsquo;give me some proof more than mere seeming and
inference, which are all I have at present, that you don&rsquo;t
think this I tell you of presumption in me!&nbsp; I have been
unable to do anything since I last saw you for pondering
uncertainly on this.&nbsp; Some proof, or little sign, that we
are one in heart!&rsquo;</p>
<p>A blush settled again on her face; and half in effort, half in
spontaneity, she put her finger on her cheek.&nbsp; He almost
devotionally kissed the spot.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Does that suffice?&rsquo; she asked, scarcely giving
her words voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; I am convinced.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then that must be the end.&nbsp; Let me drive on; the
boy will be back again soon.&rsquo;&nbsp; She spoke hastily, and
looked askance to hide the heat of her cheek.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; the tower door is open, and he will go to the top,
and waste his time in looking through the telescope.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you should rush back, for he will do some
damage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; he may do what he likes, tinker and spoil the
instrument, destroy my papers,&mdash;anything, so that he will
stay there and leave us alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She glanced up with a species of pained pleasure.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You never used to feel like that!&rsquo; she said, and
there was keen self-reproach in her voice.&nbsp; &lsquo;You were
once so devoted to your science that the thought of an intruder
into your temple would have driven you wild.&nbsp; Now you
don&rsquo;t care; and who is to blame?&nbsp; Ah, not you, not
you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The animal ambled on with her, and he, leaning on the side of
the little vehicle, kept her company.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, don&rsquo;t let us think of that,&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I offer myself and all my energies, frankly
and entirely, to you, my dear, dear lady, whose I shall be
always!&nbsp; But my words in telling you this will only injure
my meaning instead of emphasize it.&nbsp; In expressing, even to
myself, my thoughts of you, I find that I fall into phrases
which, as a critic, I should hitherto have heartily despised for
their commonness.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the use of saying, for
instance, as I have just said, that I give myself entirely to
you, and shall be yours always,&mdash;that you have my devotion,
my highest homage?&nbsp; Those words have been used so frequently
in a flippant manner that honest use of them is not
distinguishable from the unreal.&rsquo;&nbsp; He turned to her,
and added, smiling, &lsquo;Your eyes are to be my stars for the
future.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I know it,&mdash;I know it, and all you would
say!&nbsp; I dreaded even while I hoped for this, my dear young
friend,&rsquo; she replied, her eyes being full of tears.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I am injuring you; who knows that I am not ruining your
future,&mdash;I who ought to know better?&nbsp; Nothing can come
of this, nothing must,&mdash;and I am only wasting your
time.&nbsp; Why have I drawn you off from a grand celestial study
to study poor lonely me?&nbsp; Say you will never despise me,
when you get older, for this episode in our lives.&nbsp; But you
will,&mdash;I know you will!&nbsp; All men do, when they have
been attracted in their unsuspecting youth, as I have attracted
you.&nbsp; I ought to have kept my resolve.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What was that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To bear anything rather than draw you from your high
purpose; to be like the noble citizen of old Greece, who,
attending a sacrifice, let himself be burnt to the bone by a coal
that jumped into his sleeve rather than disturb the sacred
ceremony.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But can I not study and love both?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope so,&mdash;I earnestly hope so.&nbsp; But
you&rsquo;ll be the first if you do, and I am the responsible one
if you do not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You speak as if I were quite a child, and you immensely
older.&nbsp; Why, how old do you think I am?&nbsp; I am
twenty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You seem younger.&nbsp; Well, that&rsquo;s so much the
better.&nbsp; Twenty sounds strong and firm.&nbsp; How old do you
think I am?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have never thought of considering.&rsquo;&nbsp; He
innocently turned to scrutinize her face.&nbsp; She winced a
little.&nbsp; But the instinct was premature.&nbsp; Time had
taken no liberties with her features as yet; nor had trouble very
roughly handled her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will tell you,&rsquo; she replied, speaking almost
with physical pain, yet as if determination should carry her
through.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am eight-and-twenty&mdash;nearly&mdash;I
mean a little more, a few months more.&nbsp; Am I not a fearful
deal older than you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;At first it seems a great deal,&rsquo; he answered,
musing.&nbsp; &lsquo;But it doesn&rsquo;t seem much when one gets
used to it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nonsense!&rsquo; she exclaimed.&nbsp; &lsquo;It
<i>is</i> a good deal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well, then, sweetest Lady Constantine, let it
be,&rsquo; he said gently.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You should not let it be!&nbsp; A polite man would have
flatly contradicted me. . . .&nbsp; O I am ashamed of
this!&rsquo; she added a moment after, with a subdued, sad look
upon the ground.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am speaking by the card of the
outer world, which I have left behind utterly; no such lip
service is known in your sphere.&nbsp; I care nothing for those
things, really; but that which is called the Eve in us will out
sometimes.&nbsp; Well, we will forget that now, as we must, at no
very distant date, forget all the rest of this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He walked beside her thoughtfully awhile, with his eyes also
bent on the road.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why must we forget it all?&rsquo;
he inquired.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is only an interlude.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;An interlude!&nbsp; It is no interlude to me.&nbsp; O
how can you talk so lightly of this, Lady Constantine?&nbsp; And
yet, if I were to go away from here, I might, perhaps, soon
reduce it to an interlude!&nbsp; Yes,&rsquo; he resumed
impulsively, &lsquo;I will go away.&nbsp; Love dies, and it is
just as well to strangle it in its birth; it can only die
once!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no!&rsquo; she said, looking up
apprehensively.&nbsp; &lsquo;I misled you.&nbsp; It is no
interlude to me,&mdash;it is tragical.&nbsp; I only meant that
from a worldly point of view it is an interlude, which we should
try to forget.&nbsp; But the world is not all.&nbsp; You will not
go away?&rsquo;</p>
<p>But he continued drearily, &lsquo;Yes, yes, I see it all; you
have enlightened me.&nbsp; It will be hurting your prospects even
more than mine, if I stay.&nbsp; Now Sir Blount is dead, you are
free again,&mdash;may marry where you will, but for this fancy of
ours.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll leave Welland before harm comes of my
staying.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t decide to do a thing so rash!&rsquo; she
begged, seizing his hand, and looking miserable at the effect of
her words.&nbsp; &lsquo;I shall have nobody left in the world to
care for!&nbsp; And now I have given you the great telescope, and
lent you the column, it would be ungrateful to go away!&nbsp; I
was wrong; believe me that I did not mean that it was a mere
interlude to <i>me</i>.&nbsp; O if you only knew how very, very
far it is from that!&nbsp; It is my doubt of the result to you
that makes me speak so slightingly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They were now approaching cross-roads, and casually looking up
they beheld, thirty or forty yards beyond the crossing, Mr.
Torkingham, who was leaning over a gate, his back being towards
them.&nbsp; As yet he had not recognized their approach.</p>
<p>The master-passion had already supplanted St. Cleeve&rsquo;s
natural ingenuousness by subtlety.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Would it be well for us to meet Mr. Torkingham just
now?&rsquo; he began.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly not,&rsquo; she said hastily, and pulling the
rein she instantly drove down the right-hand road.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
cannot meet anybody!&rsquo; she murmured.&nbsp; &lsquo;Would it
not be better that you leave me now?&mdash;not for my pleasure,
but that there may arise no distressing tales about us before we
know&mdash;how to act in this&mdash;this&rsquo;&mdash;(she smiled
faintly at him) &lsquo;heartaching extremity!&rsquo;</p>
<p>They were passing under a huge oak-tree, whose limbs,
irregular with shoulders, knuckles, and elbows, stretched
horizontally over the lane in a manner recalling Absalom&rsquo;s
death.&nbsp; A slight rustling was perceptible amid the leafage
as they drew out from beneath it, and turning up his eyes Swithin
saw that very buttoned page whose advent they had dreaded,
looking down with interest at them from a perch not much higher
than a yard above their heads.&nbsp; He had a bunch of oak-apples
in one hand, plainly the object of his climb, and was furtively
watching Lady Constantine with the hope that she might not see
him.&nbsp; But that she had already done, though she did not
reveal it, and, fearing that the latter words of their
conversation had been overheard, they spoke not till they had
passed the next turning.</p>
<p>She stretched out her hand to his.&nbsp; &lsquo;This must not
go on,&rsquo; she said imploringly.&nbsp; &lsquo;My anxiety as to
what may be said of such methods of meeting makes me too
unhappy.&nbsp; See what has happened!&rsquo;&nbsp; She could not
help smiling.&nbsp; &lsquo;Out of the frying-pan into the
fire!&nbsp; After meanly turning to avoid the parson we have
rushed into a worse publicity.&nbsp; It is too humiliating to
have to avoid people, and lowers both you and me.&nbsp; The only
remedy is not to meet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said Swithin, with a sigh.&nbsp;
&lsquo;So it shall be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And with smiles that might more truly have been tears they
parted there and then.</p>
<h3>XV</h3>
<p>The summer passed away, and autumn, with its infinite suite of
tints, came creeping on.&nbsp; Darker grew the evenings,
tearfuller the moonlights, and heavier the dews.&nbsp; Meanwhile
the comet had waxed to its largest dimensions,&mdash;so large
that not only the nucleus but a portion of the tail had been
visible in broad day.&nbsp; It was now on the wane, though every
night the equatorial still afforded an opportunity of observing
the singular object which would soon disappear altogether from
the heavens for perhaps thousands of years.</p>
<p>But the astronomer of the Rings-Hill Speer was no longer a
match for his celestial materials.&nbsp; Scientifically he had
become but a dim vapour of himself; the lover had come into him
like an armed man, and cast out the student, and his intellectual
situation was growing a life-and-death matter.</p>
<p>The resolve of the pair had been so far kept: they had not
seen each other in private for three months.&nbsp; But on one day
in October he ventured to write a note to her:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I can do nothing!&nbsp; I have ceased to
study, ceased to observe.&nbsp; The equatorial is useless to
me.&nbsp; This affection I have for you absorbs my life, and
outweighs my intentions.&nbsp; The power to labour in this
grandest of fields has left me.&nbsp; I struggle against the
weakness till I think of the cause, and then I bless her.&nbsp;
But the very desperation of my circumstances has suggested a
remedy; and this I would inform you of at once.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can you come to me, since I must not come to you?&nbsp;
I will wait to-morrow night at the edge of the plantation by
which you would enter to the column.&nbsp; I will not detain you;
my plan can be told in ten words.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The night after posting this missive to her he waited at the
spot mentioned.</p>
<p>It was a melancholy evening for coming abroad.&nbsp; A
blusterous wind had risen during the day, and still continued to
increase.&nbsp; Yet he stood watchful in the darkness, and was
ultimately rewarded by discerning a shady muffled shape that
embodied itself from the field, accompanied by the scratching of
silk over stubble.&nbsp; There was no longer any disguise as to
the nature of their meeting.&nbsp; It was a lover&rsquo;s
assignation, pure and simple; and boldly realizing it as such he
clasped her in his arms.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot bear this any longer!&rsquo; he
exclaimed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Three months since I saw you alone!&nbsp;
Only a glimpse of you in church, or a bow from the distance, in
all that time!&nbsp; What a fearful struggle this keeping apart
has been!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yet I would have had strength to persist, since it
seemed best,&rsquo; she murmured when she could speak, &lsquo;had
not your words on your condition so alarmed and saddened
me.&nbsp; This inability of yours to work, or study, or
observe,&mdash;it is terrible!&nbsp; So terrible a sting is it to
my conscience that your hint about a remedy has brought me
instantly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yet I don&rsquo;t altogether mind it, since it is you,
my dear, who have displaced the work; and yet the loss of time
nearly distracts me, when I have neither the power to work nor
the delight of your company.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But your remedy!&nbsp; O, I cannot help guessing
it!&nbsp; Yes; you are going away!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let us ascend the column; we can speak more at ease
there.&nbsp; Then I will explain all.&nbsp; I would not ask you
to climb so high but the hut is not yet furnished.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He entered the cabin at the foot, and having lighted a small
lantern, conducted her up the hollow staircase to the top, where
he closed the slides of the dome to keep out the wind, and placed
the observing-chair for her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can stay only five minutes,&rsquo; she said, without
sitting down.&nbsp; &lsquo;You said it was important that you
should see me, and I have come.&nbsp; I assure you it is at a
great risk.&nbsp; If I am seen here at this time I am ruined for
ever.&nbsp; But what would I not do for you?&nbsp; O Swithin,
your remedy&mdash;is it to go away?&nbsp; There is no other; and
yet I dread that like death!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can tell you in a moment, but I must begin at the
beginning.&nbsp; All this ruinous idleness and distraction is
caused by the misery of our not being able to meet with
freedom.&nbsp; The fear that something may snatch you from me
keeps me in a state of perpetual apprehension.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is too true also of me!&nbsp; I dread that some
accident may happen, and waste my days in meeting the trouble
half-way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So our lives go on, and our labours stand still.&nbsp;
Now for the remedy.&nbsp; Dear Lady Constantine, allow me to
marry you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She started, and the wind without shook the building, sending
up a yet intenser moan from the firs.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I mean, marry you quite privately.&nbsp; Let it make no
difference whatever to our outward lives for years, for I know
that in my present position you could not possibly acknowledge me
as husband publicly.&nbsp; But by marrying at once we secure the
certainty that we cannot be divided by accident, coaxing, or
artifice; and, at ease on that point, I shall embrace my studies
with the old vigour, and you yours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lady Constantine was so agitated at the unexpected boldness of
such a proposal from one hitherto so boyish and deferential that
she sank into the observing-chair, her intention to remain for
only a few minutes being quite forgotten.</p>
<p>She covered her face with her hands.&nbsp; &lsquo;No, no, I
dare not!&rsquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But is there a single thing else left to do?&rsquo; he
pleaded, kneeling down beside her, less in supplication than in
abandonment.&nbsp; &lsquo;What else can we do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wait till you are famous.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I cannot be famous unless I strive, and this
distracting condition prevents all striving!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Could you not strive on if I&mdash;gave you a promise,
a solemn promise, to be yours when your name is fairly well
known?&rsquo;</p>
<p>St. Cleeve breathed heavily.&nbsp; &lsquo;It will be a long,
weary time,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;And even with your
promise I shall work but half-heartedly.&nbsp; Every hour of
study will be interrupted with &ldquo;Suppose this or this
happens;&rdquo; &ldquo;Suppose somebody persuades her to break
her promise;&rdquo; worse still, &ldquo;Suppose some rival
maligns me, and so seduces her away.&rdquo;&nbsp; No, Lady
Constantine, dearest, best as you are, that element of
distraction would still remain, and where that is, no sustained
energy is possible.&nbsp; Many erroneous things have been written
and said by the sages, but never did they float a greater fallacy
than that love serves as a stimulus to win the loved one by
patient toil.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot argue with you,&rsquo; she said weakly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My only possible other chance would lie in going
away,&rsquo; he resumed after a moment&rsquo;s reflection, with
his eyes on the lantern flame, which waved and smoked in the
currents of air that leaked into the dome from the fierce
wind-stream without.&nbsp; &lsquo;If I might take away the
equatorial, supposing it possible that I could find some suitable
place for observing in the southern hemisphere,&mdash;say, at the
Cape,&mdash;I <i>might</i> be able to apply myself to serious
work again, after the lapse of a little time.&nbsp; The southern
constellations offer a less exhausted field for
investigation.&nbsp; I wonder if I might!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You mean,&rsquo; she answered uneasily, &lsquo;that you
might apply yourself to work when your recollection of me began
to fade, and my life to become a matter of indifference to you? .
.&nbsp; Yes, go!&nbsp; No,&mdash;I cannot bear it!&nbsp; The
remedy is worse than the disease.&nbsp; I cannot let you go
away!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then how can you refuse the only condition on which I
can stay, without ruin to my purpose and scandal to your
name?&nbsp; Dearest, agree to my proposal, as you love both me
and yourself!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He waited, while the fir-trees rubbed and prodded the base of
the tower, and the wind roared around and shook it; but she could
not find words to reply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Would to God,&rsquo; he burst out, &lsquo;that I might
perish here, like Winstanley in his lighthouse!&nbsp; Then the
difficulty would be solved for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are so wrong, so very wrong, in saying so!&rsquo;
she exclaimed passionately.&nbsp; &lsquo;You may doubt my wisdom,
pity my short-sightedness; but there is one thing you do
know,&mdash;that I love you dearly!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You do,&mdash;I know it!&rsquo; he said, softened in a
moment.&nbsp; &lsquo;But it seems such a simple remedy for the
difficulty that I cannot see how you can mind adopting it, if you
care so much for me as I do for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Should we live . . . just as we are, exactly, . . .
supposing I agreed?&rsquo; she faintly inquired.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, that is my idea.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite privately, you say.&nbsp; How could&mdash;the
marriage be quite private?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would go away to London and get a license.&nbsp; Then
you could come to me, and return again immediately after the
ceremony.&nbsp; I could return at leisure and not a soul in the
world would know what had taken place.&nbsp; Think, dearest, with
what a free conscience you could then assist me in my efforts to
plumb these deeps above us!&nbsp; Any feeling that you may now
have against clandestine meetings as such would then be removed,
and our hearts would be at rest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was a certain scientific practicability even in his
love-making, and it here came out excellently.&nbsp; But she sat
on with suspended breath, her heart wildly beating, while he
waited in open-mouthed expectation.&nbsp; Each was swayed by the
emotion within them, much as the candle-flame was swayed by the
tempest without.&nbsp; It was the most critical evening of their
lives.</p>
<p>The pale rays of the little lantern fell upon her beautiful
face, snugly and neatly bound in by her black bonnet; but not a
beam of the lantern leaked out into the night to suggest to any
watchful eye that human life at its highest excitement was
beating within the dark and isolated tower; for the dome had no
windows, and every shutter that afforded an opening for the
telescope was hermetically closed.&nbsp; Predilections and
misgivings so equally strove within her still youthful breast
that she could not utter a word; her intention wheeled this way
and that like the balance of a watch.&nbsp; His unexpected
proposition had brought about the smartest encounter of
inclination with prudence, of impulse with reserve, that she had
ever known.</p>
<p>Of all the reasons that she had expected him to give for his
urgent request to see her this evening, an offer of marriage was
probably the last.&nbsp; Whether or not she had ever amused
herself with hypothetical fancies on such a subject,&mdash;and it
was only natural that she should vaguely have done so,&mdash;the
courage in her <i>protg</i> coolly to advance it, without a hint from
herself that such a proposal would be tolerated, showed her that
there was more in his character than she had reckoned on: and the
discovery almost frightened her.&nbsp; The humour, attitude, and
tenor of her attachment had been of quite an unpremeditated
quality, unsuggestive of any such audacious solution to their
distresses as this.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I repeat my question, dearest,&rsquo; he said, after
her long pause.&nbsp; &lsquo;Shall it be done?&nbsp; Or shall I
exile myself, and study as best I can, in some distant country,
out of sight and sound?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are those the only alternatives?&nbsp; Yes, yes; I
suppose they are!&rsquo;&nbsp; She waited yet another moment,
bent over his kneeling figure, and kissed his forehead.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Yes; it shall be done,&rsquo; she whispered.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I will marry you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My angel, I am content!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He drew her yielding form to his heart, and her head sank upon
his shoulder, as he pressed his two lips continuously upon
hers.&nbsp; To such had the study of celestial physics brought
them in the space of eight months, one week, and a few odd
days.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am weaker than you,&mdash;far the weaker,&rsquo; she
went on, her tears falling.&nbsp; &lsquo;Rather than lose you out
of my sight I will marry without stipulation or condition.&nbsp;
But&mdash;I put it to your kindness&mdash;grant me one little
request.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He instantly assented.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is that, in consideration of my peculiar position in
this county,&mdash;O, you can&rsquo;t understand it!&mdash;you
will not put an end to the absolute secrecy of our relationship
without my full assent.&nbsp; Also, that you will never come to
Welland House without first discussing with me the advisability
of the visit, accepting my opinion on the point.&nbsp; There, see
how a timid woman tries to fence herself in!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear lady-love, neither of those two high-handed
courses should I have taken, even had you not stipulated against
them.&nbsp; The very essence of our marriage plan is that those
two conditions are kept.&nbsp; I see as well as you do, even more
than you do, how important it is that for the present,&mdash;ay,
for a long time hence&mdash;I should still be but the
curate&rsquo;s lonely son, unattached to anybody or anything,
with no object of interest but his science; and you the recluse
lady of the manor, to whom he is only an acquaintance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;See what deceits love sows in honest minds!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It would be a humiliation to you at present that I
could not bear if a marriage between us were made public; an
inconvenience without any compensating advantage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am so glad you assume it without my setting it before
you!&nbsp; Now I know you are not only good and true, but politic
and trustworthy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then, here is our covenant.&nbsp; My lady swears
to marry me; I, in return for such great courtesy, swear never to
compromise her by intruding at Welland House, and to keep the
marriage concealed till I have won a position worthy of
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Or till I request it to be made known,&rsquo; she
added, possibly foreseeing a contingency which had not occurred
to him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Or till you request it,&rsquo; he repeated.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is agreed,&rsquo; murmured Lady Constantine,</p>
<h3>XVI</h3>
<p>After this there only remained to be settled between them the
practical details of the project.</p>
<p>These were that he should leave home in a couple of days, and
take lodgings either in the distant city of Bath or in a
convenient suburb of London, till a sufficient time should have
elapsed to satisfy legal requirements; that on a fine morning at
the end of this time she should hie away to the same place, and
be met at the station by St. Cleeve, armed with the marriage
license; whence they should at once proceed to the church fixed
upon for the ceremony; returning home independently in the course
of the next two or three days.</p>
<p>While these tactics were under discussion the two-and-thirty
winds of heaven continued, as before, to beat about the tower,
though their onsets appeared to be somewhat lessening in
force.&nbsp; Himself now calmed and satisfied, Swithin, as is the
wont of humanity, took serener views of Nature&rsquo;s crushing
mechanics without, and said, &lsquo;The wind doesn&rsquo;t seem
disposed to put the tragic period to our hopes and fears that I
spoke of in my momentary despair.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The disposition of the wind is as vicious as
ever,&rsquo; she answered, looking into his face with pausing
thoughts on, perhaps, other subjects than that discussed.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It is your mood of viewing it that has changed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it
so.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>And, as if flatly to stultify Swithin&rsquo;s assumption, a
circular hurricane, exceeding in violence any that had preceded
it, seized hold upon Rings-Hill Speer at that moment with the
determination of a conscious agent.&nbsp; The first sensation of
a resulting catastrophe was conveyed to their intelligence by the
flapping of the candle-flame against the lantern-glass; then the
wind, which hitherto they had heard rather than felt, rubbed past
them like a fugitive.&nbsp; Swithin beheld around and above him,
in place of the concavity of the dome, the open heaven, with its
racing clouds, remote horizon, and intermittent gleam of
stars.&nbsp; The dome that had covered the tower had been whirled
off bodily; and they heard it descend crashing upon the
trees.</p>
<p>Finding himself untouched Swithin stretched out his arms
towards Lady Constantine, whose apparel had been seized by the
spinning air, nearly lifting her off her legs.&nbsp; She, too,
was as yet unharmed.&nbsp; Each held the other for a moment,
when, fearing that something further would happen, they took
shelter in the staircase.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dearest, what an escape!&rsquo; he said, still holding
her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is the accident?&rsquo; she asked.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Has the whole top really gone?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The dome has been blown off the roof.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As soon as it was practicable he relit the extinguished
lantern, and they emerged again upon the leads, where the extent
of the disaster became at once apparent.&nbsp; Saving the absence
of the enclosing hemisphere all remained the same.&nbsp; The
dome, being constructed of wood, was light by comparison with the
rest of the structure, and the wheels which allowed it
horizontal, or, as Swithin expressed it, azimuth motion, denied
it a firm hold upon the walls; so that it had been lifted off
them like a cover from a pot.&nbsp; The equatorial stood in the
midst as it had stood before.</p>
<p>Having executed its grotesque purpose the wind sank to
comparative mildness.&nbsp; Swithin took advantage of this lull
by covering up the instruments with cloths, after which the
betrothed couple prepared to go downstairs.</p>
<p>But the events of the night had not yet fully disclosed
themselves.&nbsp; At this moment there was a sound of footsteps
and a knocking at the door below.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It can&rsquo;t be for me!&rsquo; said Lady
Constantine.&nbsp; &lsquo;I retired to my room before leaving the
house, and told them on no account to disturb me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She remained at the top while Swithin went down the
spiral.&nbsp; In the gloom he beheld Hannah.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Master Swithin, can ye come home!&nbsp; The wind have
blowed down the chimley that don&rsquo;t smoke, and the
pinning-end with it; and the old ancient house, that have been in
your family so long as the memory of man, is naked to the
world!&nbsp; It is a mercy that your grammer were not killed,
sitting by the hearth, poor old soul, and soon to walk wi&rsquo;
God,&mdash;for &rsquo;a &rsquo;s getting wambling on her pins,
Mr. Swithin, as aged folks do.&nbsp; As I say, &rsquo;a was all
but murdered by the elements, and doing no more harm than the
babes in the wood, nor speaking one harmful word.&nbsp; And the
fire and smoke were blowed all across house like a chapter in
Revelation; and your poor reverent father&rsquo;s features
scorched to flakes, looking like the vilest ruffian, and the gilt
frame spoiled!&nbsp; Every flitch, every eye-piece, and every
chine is buried under the walling; and I fed them pigs with my
own hands, Master Swithin, little thinking they would come to
this end.&nbsp; Do ye collect yourself, Mr. Swithin, and come at
once!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will,&mdash;I will.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll follow you in a
moment.&nbsp; Do you hasten back again and assist.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When Hannah had departed the young man ran up to Lady
Constantine, to whom he explained the accident.&nbsp; After
sympathizing with old Mrs. Martin Lady Constantine added,
&lsquo;I thought something would occur to mar our
scheme!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not quite sure of that yet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On a short consideration with him, she agreed to wait at the
top of the tower till he could come back and inform her if the
accident were really so serious as to interfere with his plan for
departure.&nbsp; He then left her, and there she sat in the dark,
alone, looking over the parapet, and straining her eyes in the
direction of the homestead.</p>
<p>At first all was obscurity; but when he had been gone about
ten minutes lights began to move to and fro in the hollow where
the house stood, and shouts occasionally mingled with the wind,
which retained some violence yet, playing over the trees beneath
her as on the strings of a lyre.&nbsp; But not a bough of them
was visible, a cloak of blackness covering everything netherward;
while overhead the windy sky looked down with a strange and
disguised face, the three or four stars that alone were visible
being so dissociated by clouds that she knew not which they
were.&nbsp; Under any other circumstances Lady Constantine might
have felt a nameless fear in thus sitting aloft on a lonely
column, with a forest groaning under her feet, and
pal&aelig;olithic dead men feeding its roots; but the recent
passionate decision stirred her pulses to an intensity beside
which the ordinary tremors of feminine existence asserted
themselves in vain.&nbsp; The apocalyptic effect of the scene
surrounding her was, indeed, not inharmonious, and afforded an
appropriate background to her intentions.</p>
<p>After what seemed to her an interminable space of time, quick
steps in the staircase became audible above the roar of the firs,
and in a few instants St. Cleeve again stood beside her.</p>
<p>The case of the homestead was serious.&nbsp; Hannah&rsquo;s
account had not been exaggerated in substance: the gable end of
the house was open to the garden; the joists, left without
support, had dropped, and with them the upper floor.&nbsp; By the
help of some labourers, who lived near, and Lady
Constantine&rsquo;s man Anthony, who was passing at the time, the
homestead had been propped up, and protected for the night by
some rickcloths; but Swithin felt that it would be selfish in the
highest degree to leave two lonely old women to themselves at
this juncture.&nbsp; &lsquo;In short,&rsquo; he concluded
despondently, &lsquo;I cannot go to stay in Bath or London just
now; perhaps not for another fortnight!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never mind,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;A fortnight
hence will do as well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I have these for you,&rsquo; he continued.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Your man Green was passing my grandmother&rsquo;s on his
way back from Warborne, where he had been, he says, for any
letters that had come for you by the evening post.&nbsp; As he
stayed to assist the other men I told him I would go on to your
house with the letters he had brought.&nbsp; Of course I did not
tell him I should see you here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you.&nbsp; Of course not.&nbsp; Now I&rsquo;ll
return at once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In descending the column her eye fell upon the superscription
of one of the letters, and she opened and glanced over it by the
lantern light.&nbsp; She seemed startled, and, musing, said,
&lsquo;The postponement of our&mdash;intention must be, I fear,
for a long time.&nbsp; I find that after the end of this month I
cannot leave home safely, even for a day.&rsquo;&nbsp; Perceiving
that he was about to ask why, she added, &lsquo;I will not
trouble you with the reason now; it would only harass you.&nbsp;
It is only a family business, and cannot be helped.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then we cannot be married till&mdash;God knows
when!&rsquo; said Swithin blankly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I cannot leave
home till after the next week or two; you cannot leave home
unless within that time.&nbsp; So what are we to do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear, dear one, don&rsquo;t let us be beaten like
this!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t let a well-considered plan be overthrown
by a mere accident!&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s a remedy.&nbsp; Do
<i>you</i> go and stay the requisite time in the parish we are to
be married in, instead of me.&nbsp; When my grandmother is again
well housed I can come to you, instead of you to me, as we first
said.&nbsp; Then it can be done within the time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Reluctantly, shyly, and yet with a certain gladness of heart,
she gave way to his proposal that they should change places in
the programme.&nbsp; There was much that she did not like in it,
she said.&nbsp; It seemed to her as if she were taking the
initiative by going and attending to the preliminaries.&nbsp; It
was the man&rsquo;s part to do that, in her opinion, and was
usually undertaken by him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But,&rsquo; argued Swithin, &lsquo;there are cases in
which the woman does give the notices, and so on; that is to say,
when the man is absolutely hindered from doing so; and ours is
such a case.&nbsp; The seeming is nothing; I know the truth, and
what does it matter?&nbsp; You do not refuse&mdash;retract your
word to be my wife, because, to avoid a sickening delay, the
formalities require you to attend to them in place of
me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She did not refuse, she said.&nbsp; In short she agreed to his
entreaty.&nbsp; They had, in truth, gone so far in their dream of
union that there was no drawing back now.&nbsp; Whichever of them
was forced by circumstances to be the protagonist in the
enterprise, the thing must be done.&nbsp; Their intention to
become husband and wife, at first halting and timorous, had
accumulated momentum with the lapse of hours, till it now bore
down every obstacle in its course.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Since you beg me to,&mdash;since there is no
alternative between my going and a long postponement,&rsquo; she
said, as they stood in the dark porch of Welland House before
parting,&mdash;&lsquo;since I am to go first, and seem to be the
pioneer in this adventure, promise me, Swithin, promise your
Viviette, that in years to come, when perhaps you may not love me
so warmly as you do now&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That will never be.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, hoping it will not, but supposing it should,
promise me that you will never reproach me as the one who took
the initiative when it should have been yourself, forgetting that
it was at your request; promise that you will never say I showed
immodest readiness to do so, or anything which may imply your
obliviousness of the fact that I act in obedience to necessity
and your earnest prayer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Need it be said that he promised never to reproach her with
that or any other thing as long as they should live?&nbsp; The
few details of the reversed arrangement were soon settled, Bath
being the place finally decided on.&nbsp; Then, with a warm
audacity which events had encouraged, he pressed her to his
breast, and she silently entered the house.&nbsp; He returned to
the homestead, there to attend to the unexpected duties of
repairing the havoc wrought by the gale.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>That night, in the solitude of her chamber, Lady Constantine
reopened and read the subjoined letter&mdash;one of those handed
to her by St. Cleeve:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;--- <span
class="smcap">Street</span>, <span
class="smcap">Piccadilly</span>,<br />
October 15, 18--.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Viviette</span>,&mdash;You
will be surprised to learn that I am in England, and that I am
again out of harness&mdash;unless you should have seen the latter
in the papers.&nbsp; Rio Janeiro may do for monkeys, but it
won&rsquo;t do for me.&nbsp; Having resigned the appointment I
have returned here, as a preliminary step to finding another vent
for my energies; in other words, another milch cow for my
sustenance.&nbsp; I knew nothing whatever of your husband&rsquo;s
death till two days ago; so that any letter from you on the
subject, at the time it became known, must have miscarried.&nbsp;
Hypocrisy at such a moment is worse than useless, and I therefore
do not condole with you, particularly as the event, though new to
a banished man like me, occurred so long since.&nbsp; You are
better without him, Viviette, and are now just the limb for doing
something for yourself, notwithstanding the threadbare state in
which you seem to have been cast upon the world.&nbsp; You are
still young, and, as I imagine (unless you have vastly altered
since I beheld you), good-looking: therefore make up your mind to
retrieve your position by a match with one of the local
celebrities; and you would do well to begin drawing neighbouring
covers at once.&nbsp; A genial squire, with more weight than wit,
more realty than weight, and more personalty than realty
(considering the circumstances), would be best for you.&nbsp; You
might make a position for us both by some such alliance; for, to
tell the truth, I have had but in-and-out luck so far.&nbsp; I
shall be with you in little more than a fortnight, when we will
talk over the matter seriously, if you don&rsquo;t
object.&mdash;Your affectionate brother,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Louis</span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was this allusion to her brother&rsquo;s coming visit which
had caught her eye in the tower staircase, and led to a
modification in the wedding arrangement.</p>
<p>Having read the letter through once Lady Constantine flung it
aside with an impatient little stamp that shook the decaying old
floor and casement.&nbsp; Its contents produced perturbation,
misgiving, but not retreat.&nbsp; The deep glow of enchantment
shed by the idea of a private union with her beautiful young
lover killed the pale light of cold reasoning from an
indifferently good relative.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, no,&rsquo; she murmured, as she sat, covering her
face with her hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;Not for wealth untold could I
give him up now!&rsquo;</p>
<p>No argument, short of Apollo in person from the clouds, would
have influenced her.&nbsp; She made her preparations for
departure as if nothing had intervened.</p>
<h3>XVII</h3>
<p>In her days of prosperity Lady Constantine had often gone to
the city of Bath, either frivolously, for shopping purposes, or
musico-religiously, to attend choir festivals in the abbey; so
there was nothing surprising in her reverting to an old
practice.&nbsp; That the journey might appear to be of a somewhat
similar nature she took with her the servant who had been
accustomed to accompany her on former occasions, though the
woman, having now left her service, and settled in the village as
the wife of Anthony Green, with a young child on her hands, could
with some difficulty leave home.&nbsp; Lady Constantine overcame
the anxious mother&rsquo;s scruples by providing that young Green
should be well cared for; and knowing that she could count upon
this woman&rsquo;s fidelity, if upon anybody&rsquo;s, in case of
an accident (for it was chiefly Lady Constantine&rsquo;s
exertions that had made an honest wife of Mrs. Green), she
departed for a fortnight&rsquo;s absence.</p>
<p>The next day found mistress and maid settled in lodgings in an
old plum-coloured brick street, which a hundred years ago could
boast of rank and fashion among its residents, though now the
broad fan-light over each broad door admitted the sun to the
halls of a lodging-house keeper only.&nbsp; The lamp-posts were
still those that had done duty with oil lights; and rheumatic old
coachmen and postilions, that once had driven and ridden
gloriously from London to Land&rsquo;s End, ornamented with their
bent persons and bow legs the pavement in front of the chief inn,
in the sorry hope of earning sixpence to keep body and soul
together.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are kept well informed on the time o&rsquo; day, my
lady,&rsquo; said Mrs. Green, as she pulled down the blinds in
Lady Constantine&rsquo;s room on the evening of their
arrival.&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a church exactly at the back
of us, and I hear every hour strike.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lady Constantine said she had noticed that there was a church
quite near.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, it is better to have that at the back than other
folks&rsquo; winders.&nbsp; And if your ladyship wants to go
there it won&rsquo;t be far to walk.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s what occurred to me,&rsquo; said Lady
Constantine, &lsquo;<i>if</i> I should want to go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>During the ensuing days she felt to the utmost the tediousness
of waiting merely that time might pass.&nbsp; Not a soul knew her
there, and she knew not a soul, a circumstance which, while it
added to her sense of secrecy, intensified her solitude.&nbsp;
Occasionally she went to a shop, with Green as her
companion.&nbsp; Though there were purchases to be made, they
were by no means of a pressing nature, and but poorly filled up
the vacancies of those strange, speculative days,&mdash;days
surrounded by a shade of fear, yet poetized by sweet
expectation.</p>
<p>On the thirteenth day she told Green that she was going to
take a walk, and leaving the house she passed by the obscurest
streets to the Abbey.&nbsp; After wandering about beneath the
aisles till her courage was screwed to its highest, she went out
at the other side, and, looking timidly round to see if anybody
followed, walked on till she came to a certain door, which she
reached just at the moment when her heart began to sink to its
very lowest, rendering all the screwing up in vain.</p>
<p>Whether it was because the month was October, or from any
other reason, the deserted aspect of the quarter in general sat
especially on this building.&nbsp; Moreover the pavement was up,
and heaps of stone and gravel obstructed the footway.&nbsp;
Nobody was coming, nobody was going, in that thoroughfare; she
appeared to be the single one of the human race bent upon
marriage business, which seemed to have been unanimously
abandoned by all the rest of the world as proven folly.&nbsp; But
she thought of Swithin, his blonde hair, ardent eyes, and
eloquent lips, and was carried onward by the very reflection.</p>
<p>Entering the surrogate&rsquo;s room Lady Constantine managed,
at the last juncture, to state her errand in tones so collected
as to startle even herself to which her listener replied also as
if the whole thing were the most natural in the world.&nbsp; When
it came to the affirmation that she had lived fifteen days in the
parish, she said with dismay&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no!&nbsp; I thought the fifteen days meant the
interval of residence before the marriage takes place.&nbsp; I
have lived here only thirteen days and a half.&nbsp; Now I must
come again!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah&mdash;well&mdash;I think you need not be so
particular,&rsquo; said the surrogate.&nbsp; &lsquo;As a matter
of fact, though the letter of the law requires fifteen
days&rsquo; residence, many people make five sufficient.&nbsp;
The provision is inserted, as you doubtless are aware, to hinder
runaway marriages as much as possible, and secret unions, and
other such objectionable practices.&nbsp; You need not come
again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>That evening Lady Constantine wrote to Swithin St. Cleeve the
last letter of the fortnight:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My
Dearest</span>,&mdash;Do come to me as soon as you can.&nbsp; By
a sort of favouring blunder I have been able to shorten the time
of waiting by a day.&nbsp; Come at once, for I am almost broken
down with apprehension.&nbsp; It seems rather rash at moments,
all this, and I wish you were here to reassure me.&nbsp; I did
not know I should feel so alarmed.&nbsp; I am frightened at every
footstep, and dread lest anybody who knows me should accost me,
and find out why I am here.&nbsp; I sometimes wonder how I could
have agreed to come and enact your part, but I did not realize
how trying it would be.&nbsp; You ought not to have asked me,
Swithin; upon my word, it was too cruel of you, and I will punish
you for it when you come!&nbsp; But I won&rsquo;t upbraid.&nbsp;
I hope the homestead is repaired that has cost me all this
sacrifice of modesty.&nbsp; If it were anybody in the world but
<i>you</i> in question I would rush home, without waiting here
for the end of it,&mdash;I really think I would!&nbsp; But,
dearest, no.&nbsp; I must show my strength now, or let it be for
ever hid.&nbsp; The barriers of ceremony are broken down between
us, and it is for the best that I am here.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And yet, at no point of this trying prelude need Lady
Constantine have feared for her strength.&nbsp; Deeds in this
connexion demand the particular kind of courage that such
perfervid women are endowed with, the courage of their emotions,
in which young men are often lamentably deficient.&nbsp; Her fear
was, in truth, the fear of being discovered in an unwonted
position; not of the act itself.&nbsp; And though her letter was
in its way a true exposition of her feeling, had it been
necessary to go through the whole legal process over again she
would have been found equal to the emergency.</p>
<p>It had been for some days a point of anxiety with her what to
do with Green during the morning of the wedding.&nbsp; Chance
unexpectedly helped her in this difficulty.&nbsp; The day before
the purchase of the license Green came to Lady Constantine with a
letter in her hand from her husband Anthony, her face as long as
a fiddle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope there&rsquo;s nothing the matter?&rsquo; said
Lady Constantine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The child&rsquo;s took bad, my lady!&rsquo; said Mrs.
Green, with suspended floods of water in her eyes.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
love the child better than I shall love all them that&rsquo;s
coming put together; for he&rsquo;s been a good boy to his mother
ever since twelve weeks afore he was born!&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas he,
a tender deary, that made Anthony marry me, and thereby turned
hisself from a little calamity to a little blessing!&nbsp; For,
as you know, the man were a backward man in the church part
o&rsquo; matrimony, my lady; though he&rsquo;ll do anything when
he&rsquo;s forced a bit by his manly feelings.&nbsp; And now to
lose the child&mdash;hoo-hoo-hoo!&nbsp; What shall I
doo!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, you want to go home at once, I
suppose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Green explained, between her sobs, that such was her
desire; and though this was a day or two sooner than her mistress
had wished to be left alone she consented to Green&rsquo;s
departure.&nbsp; So during the afternoon her woman went off, with
directions to prepare for Lady Constantine&rsquo;s return in two
or three days.&nbsp; But as the exact day of her return was
uncertain no carriage was to be sent to the station to meet her,
her intention being to hire one from the hotel.</p>
<p>Lady Constantine was now left in utter solitude to await her
lover&rsquo;s arrival.</p>
<h3>XVIII</h3>
<p>A more beautiful October morning than that of the next day
never beamed into the Welland valleys.&nbsp; The yearly
dissolution of leafage was setting in apace.&nbsp; The foliage of
the park trees rapidly resolved itself into the multitude of
complexions which mark the subtle grades of decay, reflecting wet
lights of such innumerable hues that it was a wonder to think
their beauties only a repetition of scenes that had been
exhibited there on scores of previous Octobers, and had been
allowed to pass away without a single dirge from the
imperturbable beings who walked among them.&nbsp; Far in the
shadows semi-opaque screens of blue haze made mysteries of the
commonest gravel-pit, dingle, or recess.</p>
<p>The wooden cabin at the foot of Rings-Hill Speer had been
furnished by Swithin as a sitting and sleeping apartment, some
little while before this time; for he had found it highly
convenient, during night observations at the top of the column,
to remain on the spot all night, not to disturb his grandmother
by passing in and out of the house, and to save himself the
labour of incessantly crossing the field.</p>
<p>He would much have liked to tell her the secret, and, had it
been his own to tell, would probably have done so; but sharing it
with an objector who knew not his grandmother&rsquo;s affection
so well as he did himself, there was no alternative to holding
his tongue.&nbsp; The more effectually to guard it he decided to
sleep at the cabin during the two or three nights previous to his
departure, leaving word at the homestead that in a day or two he
was going on an excursion.</p>
<p>It was very necessary to start early.&nbsp; Long before the
great eye of the sun was lifted high enough to glance into the
Welland valley, St. Cleeve arose from his bed in the cabin and
prepared to depart, cooking his breakfast upon a little stove in
the corner.&nbsp; The young rabbits, littered during the
foregoing summer, watched his preparations through the open door
from the grey dawn without, as he bustled, half dressed, in and
out under the boughs, and among the blackberries and brambles
that grew around.</p>
<p>It was a strange place for a bridegroom to perform his toilet
in, but, considering the unconventional nature of the marriage, a
not inappropriate one.&nbsp; What events had been enacted in that
earthen camp since it was first thrown up, nobody could say; but
the primitive simplicity of the young man&rsquo;s preparations
accorded well with the prehistoric spot on which they were
made.&nbsp; Embedded under his feet were possibly even now rude
trinkets that had been worn at bridal ceremonies of the early
inhabitants.&nbsp; Little signified those ceremonies to-day, or
the happiness or otherwise of the contracting parties.&nbsp; That
his own rite, nevertheless, signified much, was the inconsequent
reasoning of Swithin, as it is of many another bridegroom
besides; and he, like the rest, went on with his preparations in
that mood which sees in his stale repetition the wondrous
possibilities of an untried move.</p>
<p>Then through the wet cobwebs, that hung like movable
diaphragms on each blade and bough, he pushed his way down to the
furrow which led from the secluded fir-tree island to the wide
world beyond the field.</p>
<p>He was not a stranger to enterprise, and still less to the
contemplation of enterprise; but an enterprise such as this he
had never even outlined.&nbsp; That his dear lady was troubled at
the situation he had placed her in by not going himself on that
errand, he could see from her letter; but, believing an immediate
marriage with her to be the true way of restoring to both that
equanimity necessary to serene philosophy, he held it of little
account how the marriage was brought about, and happily began his
journey towards her place of sojourn.</p>
<p>He passed through a little copse before leaving the parish,
the smoke from newly lit fires rising like the stems of blue
trees out of the few cottage chimneys.&nbsp; Here he heard a
quick, familiar footstep in the path ahead of him, and, turning
the corner of the bushes, confronted the foot-post on his way to
Welland.&nbsp; In answer to St. Cleeve&rsquo;s inquiry if there
was anything for himself the postman handed out one letter, and
proceeded on his route.</p>
<p>Swithin opened and read the letter as he walked, till it
brought him to a standstill by the importance of its
contents.</p>
<p>They were enough to agitate a more phlegmatic youth than
he.&nbsp; He leant over the wicket which came in his path, and
endeavoured to comprehend the sense of the whole.</p>
<p>The large long envelope contained, first, a letter from a
solicitor in a northern town, informing him that his paternal
great-uncle, who had recently returned from the Cape (whither he
had gone in an attempt to repair a broken constitution), was now
dead and buried.&nbsp; This great-uncle&rsquo;s name was like a
new creation to Swithin.&nbsp; He had held no communication with
the young man&rsquo;s branch of the family for innumerable
years,&mdash;never, in fact, since the marriage of
Swithin&rsquo;s father with the simple daughter of Welland
Farm.&nbsp; He had been a bachelor to the end of his life, and
had amassed a fairly good professional fortune by a long and
extensive medical practice in the smoky, dreary, manufacturing
town in which he had lived and died.&nbsp; Swithin had always
been taught to think of him as the embodiment of all that was
unpleasant in man.&nbsp; He was narrow, sarcastic, and shrewd to
unseemliness.&nbsp; That very shrewdness had enabled him, without
much professional profundity, to establish his large and
lucrative connexion, which lay almost entirely among a class who
neither looked nor cared for drawing-room courtesies.</p>
<p>However, what Dr. St. Cleeve had been as a practitioner
matters little.&nbsp; He was now dead, and the bulk of his
property had been left to persons with whom this story has
nothing to do.&nbsp; But Swithin was informed that out of it
there was a bequest of 600 pounds a year to
himself,&mdash;payment of which was to begin with his
twenty-first year, and continue for his life, unless he should
marry before reaching the age of twenty-five.&nbsp; In the latter
precocious and objectionable event his annuity would be
forfeited.&nbsp; The accompanying letter, said the solicitor,
would explain all.</p>
<p>This, the second letter, was from his uncle to himself,
written about a month before the former&rsquo;s death, and
deposited with his will, to be forwarded to his nephew when that
event should have taken place.&nbsp; Swithin read, with the
solemnity that such posthumous epistles inspire, the following
words from one who, during life, had never once addressed
him:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear
Nephew</span>,&mdash;You will doubtless experience some
astonishment at receiving a communication from one whom you have
never personally known, and who, when this comes into your hands,
will be beyond the reach of your knowledge.&nbsp; Perhaps I am
the loser by this life-long mutual ignorance.&nbsp; Perhaps I am
much to blame for it; perhaps not.&nbsp; But such reflections are
profitless at this date: I have written with quite other views
than to work up a sentimental regret on such an amazingly remote
hypothesis as that the fact of a particular pair of people not
meeting, among the millions of other pairs of people who have
never met, is a great calamity either to the world in general or
to themselves.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The occasion of my addressing you is briefly this: Nine
months ago a report casually reached me that your scientific
studies were pursued by you with great ability, and that you were
a young man of some promise as an astronomer.&nbsp; My own
scientific proclivities rendered the report more interesting than
it might otherwise have been to me; and it came upon me quite as
a surprise that any issue of your father&rsquo;s marriage should
have so much in him, or you might have seen more of me in former
years than you are ever likely to do now.&nbsp; My health had
then begun to fail, and I was starting for the Cape, or I should
have come myself to inquire into your condition and
prospects.&nbsp; I did not return till six months later, and as
my health had not improved I sent a trusty friend to examine into
your life, pursuits, and circumstances, without your own
knowledge, and to report his observations to me.&nbsp; This he
did.&nbsp; Through him I learnt, of favourable news:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;(1) That you worked assiduously at the science of
astronomy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;(2) That everything was auspicious in the career you
had chosen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of unfavourable news:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;(1) That the small income at your command, even when
eked out by the sum to which you would be entitled on your
grandmother&rsquo;s death and the freehold of the homestead,
would be inadequate to support you becomingly as a scientific
man, whose lines of work were of a nature not calculated to
produce emoluments for many years, if ever.</p>
<p>&lsquo;(2) That there was something in your path worse than
narrow means, and that that something was a <i>woman</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To save you, if possible, from ruin on these heads, I
take the preventive measures detailed below.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The chief step is, as my solicitor will have informed
you, that, at the age of twenty-five, the sum of 600 pounds a
year be settled on you for life, provided you have not married
before reaching that age;&mdash;a yearly gift of an equal sum to
be also provisionally made to you in the interim&mdash;and, vice
versa, that if you do marry before reaching the age of
twenty-five you will receive nothing from the date of the
marriage.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One object of my bequest is that you may have resources
sufficient to enable you to travel and study the Southern
constellations.&nbsp; When at the Cape, after hearing of your
pursuits, I was much struck with the importance of those
constellations to an astronomer just pushing into notice.&nbsp;
There is more to be made of the Southern hemisphere than ever has
been made of it yet; the mine is not so thoroughly worked as the
Northern, and thither your studies should tend.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The only other preventive step in my power is that of
exhortation, at which I am not an adept.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I
say to you, Swithin St. Cleeve, don&rsquo;t make a fool of
yourself, as your father did.&nbsp; If your studies are to be
worth anything, believe me, they must be carried on without the
help of a woman.&nbsp; Avoid her, and every one of the sex, if
you mean to achieve any worthy thing.&nbsp; Eschew all of that
sort for many a year yet.&nbsp; Moreover, I say, the lady of your
acquaintance avoid in particular.&nbsp; I have heard nothing
against her moral character hitherto; I have no doubt it has been
excellent.&nbsp; She may have many good qualities, both of heart
and of mind.&nbsp; But she has, in addition to her original
disqualification as a companion for you (that is, that of sex),
these two serious drawbacks: she is much older than
yourself&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Much</i> older!&rsquo; said Swithin resentfully.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&mdash;and she is so impoverished that the title she
derives from her late husband is a positive objection.&nbsp;
Beyond this, frankly, I don&rsquo;t think well of her.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t think well of any woman who dotes upon a man younger
than herself.&nbsp; To care to be the first fancy of a young
fellow like you shows no great common sense in her.&nbsp; If she
were worth her salt she would have too much pride to be intimate
with a youth in your unassured position, to say no worse.&nbsp;
She is old enough to know that a <i>liaison</i> with her may, and
almost certainly would, be your ruin; and, on the other hand,
that a marriage would be preposterous,&mdash;unless she is a
complete goose, and in that case there is even more reason for
avoiding her than if she were in her few senses.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A woman of honourable feeling, nephew, would be careful
to do nothing to hinder you in your career, as this putting of
herself in your way most certainly will.&nbsp; Yet I hear that
she professes a great anxiety on this same future of yours as a
physicist.&nbsp; The best way in which she can show the reality
of her anxiety is by leaving you to yourself.&nbsp; Perhaps she
persuades herself that she is doing you no harm.&nbsp; Well, let
her have the benefit of the possible belief; but depend upon it
that in truth she gives the lie to her conscience by maintaining
such a transparent fallacy.&nbsp; Women&rsquo;s brains are not
formed for assisting at any profound science: they lack the power
to see things except in the concrete.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll blab
your most secret plans and theories to every one of her
acquaintance&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s got none!&rsquo; said Swithin, beginning to
get warm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&mdash;and make them appear ridiculous by announcing
them before they are matured.&nbsp; If you attempt to study with
a woman, you&rsquo;ll be ruled by her to entertain fancies
instead of theories, air-castles instead of intentions, qualms
instead of opinions, sickly prepossessions instead of reasoned
conclusions.&nbsp; Your wide heaven of study, young man, will
soon reduce itself to the miserable narrow expanse of her face,
and your myriad of stars to her two trumpery eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A woman waking a young man&rsquo;s passions just at a
moment when he is endeavouring to shine intellectually, is doing
little less than committing a crime.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Like a certain philosopher I would, upon my soul, have
all young men from eighteen to twenty-five kept under barrels;
seeing how often, in the lack of some such sequestering process,
the woman sits down before each as his destiny, and too
frequently enervates his purpose, till he abandons the most
promising course ever conceived!</p>
<p>&lsquo;But no more.&nbsp; I now leave your fate in your own
hands.&nbsp; Your well-wishing relative,</p>

<p>As coming from a bachelor and hardened misogynist of
seventy-two, the opinions herein contained were nothing
remarkable: but their practical result in restricting the sudden
endowment of Swithin&rsquo;s researches by conditions which
turned the favour into a harassment was, at this unique moment,
discomfiting and distracting in the highest degree.</p>
<p>Sensational, however, as the letter was, the passionate
intention of the day was not hazarded for more than a few minutes
thereby.&nbsp; The truth was, the caution and bribe came too
late, too unexpectedly, to be of influence.&nbsp; They were the
sort of thing which required fermentation to render them
effective.&nbsp; Had St. Cleeve received the exhortation a month
earlier; had he been able to run over in his mind, at every
wakeful hour of thirty consecutive nights, a private catechism on
the possibilities opened up by this annuity, there is no telling
what might have been the stress of such a web of perplexity upon
him, a young man whose love for celestial physics was second to
none.&nbsp; But to have held before him, at the last moment, the
picture of a future advantage that he had never once thought of,
or discounted for present staying power, it affected him about as
much as the view of horizons shown by sheet-lightning.&nbsp; He
saw an immense prospect; it went, and the world was as
before.</p>
<p>He caught the train at Warborne, and moved rapidly towards
Bath; not precisely in the same key as when he had dressed in the
hut at dawn, but, as regarded the mechanical part of the journey,
as unhesitatingly as before.</p>
<p>And with the change of scene even his gloom left him; his
bosom&rsquo;s lord sat lightly in his throne.&nbsp; St. Cleeve
was not sufficiently in mind of poetical literature to remember
that wise poets are accustomed to read that lightness of bosom
inversely.&nbsp; Swithin thought it an omen of good fortune; and
as thinking is causing in not a few such cases, he was perhaps,
in spite of poets, right.</p>
<h3>XIX</h3>
<p>At the station Lady Constantine appeared, standing expectant;
he saw her face from the window of the carriage long before she
saw him.&nbsp; He no sooner saw her than he was satisfied to his
heart&rsquo;s content with his prize.&nbsp; If his great-uncle
had offered him from the grave a kingdom instead of her, he would
not have accepted it.</p>
<p>Swithin jumped out, and nature never painted in a
woman&rsquo;s face more devotion than appeared in my lady&rsquo;s
at that moment.&nbsp; To both the situation seemed like a
beautiful allegory, not to be examined too closely, lest its
defects of correspondence with real life should be apparent.</p>
<p>They almost feared to shake hands in public, so much depended
upon their passing that morning without molestation.&nbsp; A fly
was called and they drove away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take this,&rsquo; she said, handing him a folded
paper.&nbsp; &lsquo;It belongs to you rather than to
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At crossings, and other occasional pauses, pedestrians turned
their faces and looked at the pair (for no reason but that, among
so many, there were naturally a few of the sort who have eyes to
note what incidents come in their way as they plod on); but the
two in the vehicle could not but fear that these innocent
beholders had special detective designs on them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You look so dreadfully young!&rsquo; she said with
humorous fretfulness, as they drove along (Swithin&rsquo;s cheeks
being amazingly fresh from the morning air).&nbsp; &lsquo;Do try
to appear a little haggard, that the parson mayn&rsquo;t ask us
awkward questions!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nothing further happened, and they were set down opposite a
shop about fifty yards from the church door, at five minutes to
eleven.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We will dismiss the fly,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It will only attract idlers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On turning the corner and reaching the church they found the
door ajar; but the building contained only two persons, a man and
a woman,&mdash;the clerk and his wife, as they learnt.&nbsp;
Swithin asked when the clergyman would arrive.</p>
<p>The clerk looked at his watch, and said, &lsquo;At just on
eleven o&rsquo;clock.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He ought to be here,&rsquo; said Swithin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; replied the clerk, as the hour
struck.&nbsp; &lsquo;The fact is, sir, he is a deppity, and apt
to be rather wandering in his wits as regards time and such like,
which hev stood in the way of the man&rsquo;s getting a
benefit.&nbsp; But no doubt he&rsquo;ll come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The regular incumbent is away, then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s gone for his bare pa&rsquo;son&rsquo;s
fortnight,&mdash;that&rsquo;s all; and we was forced to put up
with a weak-talented man or none.&nbsp; The best men goes into
the brewing, or into the shipping now-a-days, you see, sir;
doctrines being rather shaddery at present, and your
money&rsquo;s worth not sure in our line.&nbsp; So we church
officers be left poorly provided with men for odd jobs.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll tell ye what, sir; I think I&rsquo;d better run round
to the gentleman&rsquo;s lodgings, and try to find
him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pray do,&rsquo; said Lady Constantine.</p>
<p>The clerk left the church; his wife busied herself with
dusting at the further end, and Swithin and Viviette were left to
themselves.&nbsp; The imagination travels so rapidly, and a
woman&rsquo;s forethought is so assumptive, that the
clerk&rsquo;s departure had no sooner doomed them to inaction
than it was borne in upon Lady Constantine&rsquo;s mind that she
would not become the wife of Swithin St. Cleeve, either to-day or
on any other day.&nbsp; Her divinations were continually
misleading her, she knew: but a hitch at the moment of marriage
surely had a meaning in it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah,&mdash;the marriage is not to be!&rsquo; she said to
herself.&nbsp; &lsquo;This is a fatality.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was twenty minutes past, and no parson had arrived.&nbsp;
Swithin took her hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If it cannot be to-day, it can be to-morrow,&rsquo; he
whispered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot say,&rsquo; she answered.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Something tells me <i>no</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was almost impossible that she could know anything of the
deterrent force exercised on Swithin by his dead uncle that
morning.&nbsp; Yet her manner tallied so curiously well with such
knowledge that he was struck by it, and remained silent.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have a black tie,&rsquo; she continued, looking at
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; replied Swithin.&nbsp; &lsquo;I bought it
on my way here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why could it not have been less sombre in
colour?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My great-uncle is dead.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You had a great-uncle?&nbsp; You never told
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never saw him in my life.&nbsp; I have only heard
about him since his death.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He spoke in as quiet and measured a way as he could, but his
heart was sinking.&nbsp; She would go on questioning; he could
not tell her an untruth.&nbsp; She would discover particulars of
that great-uncle&rsquo;s provision for him, which he, Swithin,
was throwing away for her sake, and she would refuse to be his
for his own sake.&nbsp; His conclusion at this moment was
precisely what hers had been five minutes sooner: they were never
to be husband and wife.</p>
<p>But she did not continue her questions, for the simplest of
all reasons: hasty footsteps were audible in the entrance, and
the parson was seen coming up the aisle, the clerk behind him
wiping the beads of perspiration from his face.&nbsp; The
somewhat sorry clerical specimen shook hands with them, and
entered the vestry; and the clerk came up and opened the
book.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The poor gentleman&rsquo;s memory is a bit
topsy-turvy,&rsquo; whispered the latter.&nbsp; &lsquo;He had got
it in his mind that &rsquo;twere a funeral, and I found him
wandering about the cemetery a-looking for us.&nbsp; However,
all&rsquo;s well as ends well.&rsquo;&nbsp; And the clerk wiped
his forehead again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How ill-omened!&rsquo; murmured Viviette.</p>
<p>But the parson came out robed at this moment, and the clerk
put on his ecclesiastical countenance and looked in his
book.&nbsp; Lady Constantine&rsquo;s momentary languor passed;
her blood resumed its courses with a new spring.&nbsp; The grave
utterances of the church then rolled out upon the palpitating
pair, and no couple ever joined their whispers thereto with more
fervency than they.</p>
<p>Lady Constantine (as she continued to be called by the outside
world, though she liked to think herself the Mrs. St. Cleeve that
she legally was) had told Green that she might be expected at
Welland in a day, or two, or three, as circumstances should
dictate.&nbsp; Though the time of return was thus left open it
was deemed advisable, by both Swithin and herself, that her
journey back should not be deferred after the next day, in case
any suspicions might be aroused.&nbsp; As for St. Cleeve, his
comings and goings were of no consequence.&nbsp; It was seldom
known whether he was at home or abroad, by reason of his frequent
seclusion at the column.</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon of the next day he accompanied her to
the Bath station, intending himself to remain in that city till
the following morning.&nbsp; But when a man or youth has such a
tender article on his hands as a thirty-hour bride it is hardly
in the power of his strongest reason to set her down at a
railway, and send her off like a superfluous portmanteau.&nbsp;
Hence the experiment of parting so soon after their union proved
excruciatingly severe to these.&nbsp; The evening was dull; the
breeze of autumn crept fitfully through every slit and aperture
in the town; not a soul in the world seemed to notice or care
about anything they did.&nbsp; Lady Constantine sighed; and there
was no resisting it,&mdash;he could not leave her thus.&nbsp; He
decided to get into the train with her, and keep her company for
at least a few stations on her way.</p>
<p>It drew on to be a dark night, and, seeing that there was no
serious risk after all, he prolonged his journey with her so far
as to the junction at which the branch line to Warborne forked
off.&nbsp; Here it was necessary to wait a few minutes, before
either he could go back or she could go on.&nbsp; They wandered
outside the station doorway into the gloom of the road, and there
agreed to part.</p>
<p>While she yet stood holding his arm a phaeton sped towards the
station-entrance, where, in ascending the slope to the door, the
horse suddenly jibbed.&nbsp; The gentleman who was driving, being
either impatient, or possessed with a theory that all jibbers may
be started by severe whipping, applied the lash; as a result of
it, the horse thrust round the carriage to where they stood, and
the end of the driver&rsquo;s sweeping whip cut across Lady
Constantine&rsquo;s face with such severity as to cause her an
involuntary cry.&nbsp; Swithin turned her round to the lamplight,
and discerned a streak of blood on her cheek.</p>
<p>By this time the gentleman who had done the mischief, with
many words of regret, had given the reins to his man and
dismounted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will go to the waiting-room for a moment,&rsquo;
whispered Viviette hurriedly; and, loosing her hand from his arm,
she pulled down her veil and vanished inside the building.</p>
<p>The stranger came forward and raised his hat.&nbsp; He was a
slightly built and apparently town-bred man of twenty-eight or
thirty; his manner of address was at once careless and
conciliatory.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am greatly concerned at what I have done,&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I sincerely trust that your
wife&rsquo;&mdash;but observing the youthfulness of Swithin, he
withdrew the word suggested by the manner of Swithin towards Lady
Constantine&mdash;&lsquo;I trust the young lady was not seriously
cut?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I trust not,&rsquo; said Swithin, with some
vexation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where did the lash touch her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Straight down her cheek.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do let me go to her, and learn how she is, and humbly
apologize.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll inquire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He went to the ladies&rsquo; room, in which Viviette had taken
refuge.&nbsp; She met him at the door, her handkerchief to her
cheek, and Swithin explained that the driver of the phaeton had
sent to make inquiries.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot see him!&rsquo; she whispered.&nbsp; &lsquo;He
is my brother Louis!&nbsp; He is, no doubt, going on by the train
to my house.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t let him recognize me!&nbsp; We
must wait till he is gone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Swithin thereupon went out again, and told the young man that
the cut on her face was not serious, but that she could not see
him; after which they parted.&nbsp; St. Cleeve then heard him ask
for a ticket for Warborne, which confirmed Lady
Constantine&rsquo;s view that he was going on to her house.&nbsp;
When the branch train had moved off Swithin returned to his
bride, who waited in a trembling state within.</p>
<p>On being informed that he had departed she showed herself much
relieved.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where does your brother come from?&rsquo; said
Swithin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;From London, immediately.&nbsp; Rio before that.&nbsp;
He has a friend or two in this neighbourhood, and visits here
occasionally.&nbsp; I have seldom or never spoken to you of him,
because of his long absence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is he going to settle near you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, nor anywhere, I fear.&nbsp; He is, or rather was,
in the diplomatic service.&nbsp; He was first a clerk in the
Foreign Office, and was afterwards appointed attach at Rio
Janeiro.&nbsp; But he has resigned the appointment.&nbsp; I wish
he had not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Swithin asked why he resigned.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He complained of the banishment, and the climate, and
everything that people complain of who are determined to be
dissatisfied,&mdash;though, poor fellow, there is some ground for
his complaints.&nbsp; Perhaps some people would say that he is
idle.&nbsp; But he is scarcely that; he is rather restless than
idle, so that he never persists in anything.&nbsp; Yet if a
subject takes his fancy he will follow it up with exemplary
patience till something diverts him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is not kind to you, is he, dearest?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why do you think that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your manner seems to say so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, he may not always be kind.&nbsp; But look at my
face; does the mark show?&rsquo;</p>
<p>A streak, straight as a meridian, was visible down her
cheek.&nbsp; The blood had been brought almost to the surface,
but was not quite through, that which had originally appeared
thereon having possibly come from the horse.&nbsp; It signified
that to-morrow the red line would be a black one.</p>
<p>Swithin informed her that her brother had taken a ticket for
Warborne, and she at once perceived that he was going on to visit
her at Welland, though from his letter she had not expected him
so soon by a few days.&nbsp; &lsquo;Meanwhile,&rsquo; continued
Swithin, &lsquo;you can now get home only by the late train,
having missed that one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, Swithin, don&rsquo;t you see my new trouble?&nbsp;
If I go to Welland House to-night, and find my brother just
arrived there, and he sees this cut on my face, which I suppose
you described to him&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He will know I was the lady with you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whom he called my wife.&nbsp; I wonder why we look
husband and wife already!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then what am I to do?&nbsp; For the ensuing three or
four days I bear in my face a clue to his discovery of our
secret.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you must not be seen.&nbsp; We must stay at an inn
here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no!&rsquo; she said timidly.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is too
near home to be quite safe.&nbsp; We might not be known; but
<i>if</i> we were!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We can&rsquo;t go back to Bath now.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
tell you, dear Viviette, what we must do.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll go on
to Warborne in separate carriages; we&rsquo;ll meet outside the
station; thence we&rsquo;ll walk to the column in the dark, and
I&rsquo;ll keep you a captive in the cabin till the scar has
disappeared.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As there was nothing which better recommended itself this
course was decided on; and after taking from her trunk the
articles that might be required for an incarceration of two or
three days they left the said trunk at the cloak-room, and went
on by the last train, which reached Warborne about ten
o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>It was only necessary for Lady Constantine to cover her face
with the thick veil that she had provided for this escapade, to
walk out of the station without fear of recognition.&nbsp; St.
Cleeve came forth from another compartment, and they did not
rejoin each other till they had reached a shadowy bend in the old
turnpike road, beyond the irradiation of the Warborne
lamplight.</p>
<p>The walk to Welland was long.&nbsp; It was the walk which
Swithin had taken in the rain when he had learnt the fatal
forestalment of his stellar discovery; but now he was moved by a
less desperate mood, and blamed neither God nor man.&nbsp; They
were not pressed for time, and passed along the silent, lonely
way with that sense rather of predestination than of choice in
their proceedings which the presence of night sometimes
imparts.&nbsp; Reaching the park gate, they found it open, and
from this they inferred that her brother Louis had arrived.</p>
<p>Leaving the house and park on their right they traced the
highway yet a little further, and, plunging through the stubble
of the opposite field, drew near the isolated earthwork bearing
the plantation and tower, which together rose like a flattened
dome and lantern from the lighter-hued plain of stubble.&nbsp; It
was far too dark to distinguish firs from other trees by the eye
alone, but the peculiar dialect of sylvan language which the piny
multitude used would have been enough to proclaim their class at
any time.&nbsp; In the lovers&rsquo; stealthy progress up the
slopes a dry stick here and there snapped beneath their feet,
seeming like a shot of alarm.</p>
<p>On being unlocked the hut was found precisely as Swithin had
left it two days before.&nbsp; Lady Constantine was thoroughly
wearied, and sat down, while he gathered a handful of twigs and
spikelets from the masses strewn without and lit a small fire,
first taking the precaution to blind the little window and relock
the door.</p>
<p>Lady Constantine looked curiously around by the light of the
blaze.&nbsp; The hut was small as the prophet&rsquo;s chamber
provided by the Shunammite: in one corner stood the stove, with a
little table and chair, a small cupboard hard by, a pitcher of
water, a rack overhead, with various articles, including a kettle
and a gridiron; while the remaining three or four feet at the
other end of the room was fitted out as a dormitory, for
Swithin&rsquo;s use during late observations in the tower
overhead.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not much of a palace to offer you,&rsquo; he
remarked, smiling.&nbsp; &lsquo;But at any rate, it is a
refuge.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The cheerful firelight dispersed in some measure Lady
Constantine&rsquo;s anxieties.&nbsp; &lsquo;If we only had
something to eat!&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear me,&rsquo; cried St. Cleeve, blankly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a thing I never thought of.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nor I, till now,&rsquo; she replied.</p>
<p>He reflected with misgiving.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Beyond a small loaf of bread in the cupboard I have
nothing.&nbsp; However, just outside the door there are lots of
those little rabbits, about the size of rats, that the keepers
call runners.&nbsp; And they are as tame as possible.&nbsp; But I
fear I could not catch one now.&nbsp; Yet, dear Viviette, wait a
minute; I&rsquo;ll try.&nbsp; You must not be starved.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He softly let himself out, and was gone some time.&nbsp; When
he reappeared, he produced, not a rabbit, but four sparrows and a
thrush.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I could do nothing in the way of a rabbit without
setting a wire,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I have managed
to get these by knowing where they roost.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He showed her how to prepare the birds, and, having set her to
roast them by the fire, departed with the pitcher, to replenish
it at the brook which flowed near the homestead in the
neighbouring Bottom.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They are all asleep at my grandmother&rsquo;s,&rsquo;
he informed her when he re-entered, panting, with the dripping
pitcher.&nbsp; &lsquo;They imagine me to be a hundred miles
off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The birds were now ready, and the table was spread.&nbsp; With
this fare, eked out by dry toast from the loaf, and moistened
with cups of water from the pitcher, to which Swithin added a
little wine from the flask he had carried on his journey, they
were forced to be content for their supper.</p>
<h3>XX</h3>
<p>When Lady Constantine awoke the next morning Swithin was
nowhere to be seen.&nbsp; Before she was quite ready for
breakfast she heard the key turn in the door, and felt startled,
till she remembered that the comer could hardly be anybody but
he.&nbsp; He brought a basket with provisions, an extra
cup-and-saucer, and so on.&nbsp; In a short space of time the
kettle began singing on the stove, and the morning meal was
ready.</p>
<p>The sweet resinous air from the firs blew in upon them as they
sat at breakfast; the birds hopped round the door (which,
somewhat riskily, they ventured to keep open); and at their elbow
rose the lank column into an upper realm of sunlight, which only
reached the cabin in fitful darts and flashes through the
trees.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I could be happy here for ever,&rsquo; said she,
clasping his hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;I wish I could never see my great
gloomy house again, since I am not rich enough to throw it open,
and live there as I ought to do.&nbsp; Poverty of this sort is
not unpleasant at any rate.&nbsp; What are you thinking
of?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am thinking about my outing this morning.&nbsp; On
reaching my grandmother&rsquo;s she was only a little surprised
to see me.&nbsp; I was obliged to breakfast there, or appear to
do so, to divert suspicion; and this food is supposed to be
wanted for my dinner and supper.&nbsp; There will of course be no
difficulty in my obtaining an ample supply for any length of
time, as I can take what I like from the buttery without
observation.&nbsp; But as I looked in my grandmother&rsquo;s face
this morning, and saw her looking affectionately in mine, and
thought how she had never concealed anything from me, and had
always had my welfare at heart, I felt&mdash;that I should like
to tell her what we have done.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no,&mdash;please not, Swithin!&rsquo; she exclaimed
piteously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; he answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;On no
consideration will I do so without your consent.&rsquo;&nbsp; And
no more was said on the matter.</p>
<p>The morning was passed in applying wet rag and other remedies
to the purple line on Viviette&rsquo;s cheek; and in the
afternoon they set up the equatorial under the replaced dome, to
have it in order for night observations.</p>
<p>The evening was clear, dry, and remarkably cold by comparison
with the daytime weather.&nbsp; After a frugal supper they
replenished the stove with charcoal from the homestead, which
they also burnt during the day,&mdash;an idea of
Viviette&rsquo;s, that the smoke from a wood fire might not be
seen more frequently than was consistent with the occasional
occupation of the cabin by Swithin, as heretofore.</p>
<p>At eight o&rsquo;clock she insisted upon his ascending the
tower for observations, in strict pursuance of the idea on which
their marriage had been based, namely, that of restoring
regularity to his studies.</p>
<p>The sky had a new and startling beauty that night.&nbsp; A
broad, fluctuating, semicircular arch of vivid white light
spanned the northern quarter of the heavens, reaching from the
horizon to the star Eta in the Greater Bear.&nbsp; It was the
Aurora Borealis, just risen up for the winter season out of the
freezing seas of the north, where every autumn vapour was now
undergoing rapid congelation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, let us sit and look at it!&rsquo; she said; and they
turned their backs upon the equatorial and the southern glories
of the heavens to this new beauty in a quarter which they seldom
contemplated.</p>
<p>The lustre of the fixed stars was diminished to a sort of
blueness.&nbsp; Little by little the arch grew higher against the
dark void, like the form of the Spirit-maiden in the shades of
Glenfinlas, till its crown drew near the zenith, and threw a
tissue over the whole waggon and horses of the great northern
constellation.&nbsp; Brilliant shafts radiated from the convexity
of the arch, coming and going silently.&nbsp; The temperature
fell, and Lady Constantine drew her wrap more closely around
her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll go down,&rsquo; said Swithin.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The cabin is beautifully warm.&nbsp; Why should we try to
observe to-night?&nbsp; Indeed, we cannot; the Aurora light
overpowers everything.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well.&nbsp; To-morrow night there will be no
interruption.&nbsp; I shall be gone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You leave me to-morrow, Viviette?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; to-morrow morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The truth was that, with the progress of the hours and days,
the conviction had been borne in upon Viviette more and more
forcibly that not for kingdoms and principalities could she
afford to risk the discovery of her presence here by any living
soul.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But let me see your face, dearest,&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think it will be safe for you to
meet your brother yet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As it was too dark to see her face on the summit where they
sat they descended the winding staircase, and in the cabin
Swithin examined the damaged cheek.&nbsp; The line, though so far
attenuated as not to be observable by any one but a close
observer, had not quite disappeared.&nbsp; But in consequence of
her reiterated and almost tearful anxiety to go, and as there was
a strong probability that her brother had left the house, Swithin
decided to call at Welland next morning, and reconnoitre with a
view to her return.</p>
<p>Locking her in he crossed the dewy stubble into the
park.&nbsp; The house was silent and deserted; and only one tall
stalk of smoke ascended from the chimneys.&nbsp; Notwithstanding
that the hour was nearly nine he knocked at the door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is Lady Constantine at home?&rsquo; asked Swithin, with
a disingenuousness now habitual, yet unknown to him six months
before.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Mr. St. Cleeve; my lady has not returned from
Bath.&nbsp; We expect her every day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nobody staying in the house?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My lady&rsquo;s brother has been here; but he is gone
on to Budmouth.&nbsp; He will come again in two or three weeks, I
understand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This was enough.&nbsp; Swithin said he would call again, and
returned to the cabin, where, waking Viviette, who was not by
nature an early riser, he waited on the column till she was ready
to breakfast.&nbsp; When this had been shared they prepared to
start.</p>
<p>A long walk was before them.&nbsp; Warborne station lay five
miles distant, and the next station above that nine miles.&nbsp;
They were bound for the latter; their plan being that she should
there take the train to the junction where the whip accident had
occurred, claim her luggage, and return with it to Warborne, as
if from Bath.</p>
<p>The morning was cool and the walk not wearisome.&nbsp; When
once they had left behind the stubble-field of their environment
and the parish of Welland, they sauntered on comfortably, Lady
Constantine&rsquo;s spirits rising as she withdrew further from
danger.</p>
<p>They parted by a little brook, about half a mile from the
station; Swithin to return to Welland by the way he had come.</p>
<p>Lady Constantine telegraphed from the junction to Warborne for
a carriage to be in readiness to meet her on her arrival; and
then, waiting for the down train, she travelled smoothly home,
reaching Welland House about five minutes sooner than Swithin
reached the column hard by, after footing it all the way from
where they had parted.</p>
<h3>XXI</h3>
<p>From that day forward their life resumed its old channel in
general outward aspect.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most remarkable feature in their exploit was its
comparative effectiveness as an expedient for the end
designed,&mdash;that of restoring calm assiduity to the study of
astronomy.&nbsp; Swithin took up his old position as the lonely
philosopher at the column, and Lady Constantine lapsed back to
immured existence at the house, with apparently not a friend in
the parish.&nbsp; The enforced narrowness of life which her
limited resources necessitated was now an additional safeguard
against the discovery of her relations with St. Cleeve.&nbsp; Her
neighbours seldom troubled her; as much, it must be owned, from a
tacit understanding that she was not in a position to return
invitations as from any selfish coldness engendered by her want
of wealth.</p>
<p>At the first meeting of the secretly united pair after their
short honeymoon they were compelled to behave as strangers to
each other.&nbsp; It occurred in the only part of Welland which
deserved the name of a village street, and all the labourers were
returning to their midday meal, with those of their wives who
assisted at outdoor work.&nbsp; Before the eyes of this innocent
though quite untrustworthy group, Swithin and his Viviette could
only shake hands in passing, though she contrived to say to him
in an undertone, &lsquo;My brother does not return yet for some
time.&nbsp; He has gone to Paris.&nbsp; I will be on the lawn
this evening, if you can come.&rsquo;&nbsp; It was a fluttered
smile that she bestowed on him, and there was no doubt that every
fibre of her heart vibrated afresh at meeting, with such reserve,
one who stood in his close relation to her.</p>
<p>The shades of night fell early now, and Swithin was at the
spot of appointment about the time that he knew her dinner would
be over.&nbsp; It was just where they had met at the beginning of
the year, but many changes had resulted since then.&nbsp; The
flower-beds that had used to be so neatly edged were now jagged
and leafy; black stars appeared on the pale surface of the gravel
walks, denoting tufts of grass that grew unmolested there.&nbsp;
Lady Constantine&rsquo;s external affairs wore just that aspect
which suggests that new blood may be advantageously introduced
into the line; and new blood had been introduced, in good
sooth,&mdash;with what social result remained to be seen.</p>
<p>She silently entered on the scene from the same window which
had given her passage in months gone by.&nbsp; They met with a
concerted embrace, and St. Cleeve spoke his greeting in
whispers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are quite safe, dearest,&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But the servants?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My meagre staff consists of only two women and the boy;
and they are away in the other wing.&nbsp; I thought you would
like to see the inside of my house, after showing me the inside
of yours.&nbsp; So we will walk through it instead of staying out
here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She let him in through the casement, and they strolled forward
softly, Swithin with some curiosity, never before having gone
beyond the library and adjoining room.&nbsp; The whole western
side of the house was at this time shut up, her life being
confined to two or three small rooms in the south-east
corner.&nbsp; The great apartments through which they now
whisperingly walked wore already that funereal aspect that comes
from disuse and inattention.&nbsp; Triangular cobwebs already
formed little hammocks for the dust in corners of the wainscot,
and a close smell of wood and leather, seasoned with
mouse-droppings, pervaded the atmosphere.&nbsp; So seldom was the
solitude of these chambers intruded on by human feet that more
than once a mouse stood and looked the twain in the face from the
arm of a sofa, or the top of a cabinet, without any great
fear.</p>
<p>Swithin had no residential ambition whatever, but he was
interested in the place.&nbsp; &lsquo;Will the house ever be
thrown open to gaiety, as it was in old times?&rsquo; said
he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not unless you make a fortune,&rsquo; she replied
laughingly.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is mine for my life, as you know; but
the estate is so terribly saddled with annuities to Sir
Blount&rsquo;s distant relatives, one of whom will succeed me
here, that I have practically no more than my own little private
income to exist on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And are you bound to occupy the house?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not bound to.&nbsp; But I must not let it on
lease.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And was there any stipulation in the event of your
re-marriage?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was not mentioned.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is satisfactory to find that you lose nothing by
marrying me, at all events, dear Viviette.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope you lose nothing either&mdash;at least, of
consequence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What have I to lose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I meant your liberty.&nbsp; Suppose you become a
popular physicist (popularity seems cooling towards art and
coquetting with science now-a-days), and a better chance offers,
and one who would make you a newer and brighter wife than I am
comes in your way.&nbsp; Will you never regret this?&nbsp; Will
you never despise me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Swithin answered by a kiss, and they again went on; proceeding
like a couple of burglars, lest they should draw the attention of
the cook or Green.</p>
<p>In one of the upper rooms his eyes were attracted by an old
chamber organ, which had once been lent for use in the
church.&nbsp; He mentioned his recollection of the same, which
led her to say, &lsquo;That reminds me of something.&nbsp; There
is to be a confirmation in our parish in the spring, and you once
told me that you had never been confirmed.&nbsp; What shocking
neglect!&nbsp; Why was it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hardly know.&nbsp; The confusion resulting from my
father&rsquo;s death caused it to be forgotten, I
suppose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, dear Swithin, you will do this to please
me,&mdash;be confirmed on the present occasion?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Since I have done without the virtue of it so long,
might I not do without it altogether?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no!&rsquo; she said earnestly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I do
wish it, indeed.&nbsp; I am made unhappy when I think you
don&rsquo;t care about such serious matters.&nbsp; Without the
Church to cling to, what have we?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Each other.&nbsp; But seriously, I should be inverting
the established order of spiritual things; people ought to be
confirmed before they are married.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s really of minor consequence.&nbsp; Now,
don&rsquo;t think slightingly of what so many good men have laid
down as necessary to be done.&nbsp; And, dear Swithin, I somehow
feel that a certain levity which has perhaps shown itself in our
treatment of the sacrament of marriage&mdash;by making a
clandestine adventure of what is, after all, a solemn
rite&mdash;would be well atoned for by a due seriousness in other
points of religious observance.&nbsp; This opportunity should
therefore not be passed over.&nbsp; I thought of it all last
night; and you are a parson&rsquo;s son, remember, and he would
have insisted on it if he had been alive.&nbsp; In short,
Swithin, do be a good boy, and observe the Church&rsquo;s
ordinances.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lady Constantine, by virtue of her temperament, was
necessarily either lover or <i>d&eacute;vote</i>, and she
vibrated so gracefully between these two conditions that nobody
who had known the circumstances could have condemned her
inconsistencies.&nbsp; To be led into difficulties by those
mastering emotions of hers, to aim at escape by turning round and
seizing the apparatus of religion&mdash;which could only rightly
be worked by the very emotions already bestowed
elsewhere&mdash;it was, after all, but Nature&rsquo;s
well-meaning attempt to preserve the honour of her
daughter&rsquo;s conscience in the trying quandary to which the
conditions of sex had given rise.&nbsp; As Viviette could not be
confirmed herself, and as Communion Sunday was a long way off,
she urged Swithin thus.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And the new bishop is such a good man,&rsquo; she
continued.&nbsp; &lsquo;I used to have a slight acquaintance with
him when he was a parish priest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well, dearest.&nbsp; To please you I&rsquo;ll be
confirmed.&nbsp; My grandmother, too, will be delighted, no
doubt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They continued their ramble: Lady Constantine first advancing
into rooms with the candle, to assure herself that all was empty,
and then calling him forward in a whisper.&nbsp; The stillness
was broken only by these whispers, or by the occasional crack of
a floor-board beneath their tread.&nbsp; At last they sat down,
and, shading the candle with a screen, she showed him the faded
contents of this and that drawer or cabinet, or the wardrobe of
some member of the family who had died young early in the
century, when muslin reigned supreme, when waists were close to
arm-pits, and muffs as large as smugglers&rsquo; tubs.&nbsp;
These researches among habilimental hulls and husks, whose human
kernels had long ago perished, went on for about half an hour;
when the companions were startled by a loud ringing at the
front-door bell.</p>
<h3>XXII</h3>
<p>Lady Constantine flung down the old-fashioned lacework, whose
beauties she had been pointing out to Swithin, and exclaimed,
&lsquo;Who can it be?&nbsp; Not Louis, surely?&rsquo;</p>
<p>They listened.&nbsp; An arrival was such a phenomenon at this
unfrequented mansion, and particularly a late arrival, that no
servant was on the alert to respond to the call; and the visitor
rang again, more loudly than before.&nbsp; Sounds of the tardy
opening and shutting of a passage-door from the kitchen quarter
then reached their ears, and Viviette went into the corridor to
hearken more attentively.&nbsp; In a few minutes she returned to
the wardrobe-room in which she had left Swithin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; it is my brother!&rsquo; she said with difficult
composure.&nbsp; &lsquo;I just caught his voice.&nbsp; He has no
doubt come back from Paris to stay.&nbsp; This is a rather
vexatious, indolent way he has, never to write to prepare
me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can easily go away,&rsquo; said Swithin.</p>
<p>By this time, however, her brother had been shown into the
house, and the footsteps of the page were audible, coming in
search of Lady Constantine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you will wait there a moment,&rsquo; she said,
directing St. Cleeve into a bedchamber which adjoined; &lsquo;you
will be quite safe from interruption, and I will quickly come
back.&rsquo;&nbsp; Taking the light she left him.</p>
<p>Swithin waited in darkness.&nbsp; Not more than ten minutes
had passed when a whisper in her voice came through the
keyhole.&nbsp; He opened the door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; he is come to stay!&rsquo; she said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He is at supper now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well; don&rsquo;t be flurried, dearest.&nbsp;
Shall I stay too, as we planned?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, Swithin, I fear not!&rsquo; she replied
anxiously.&nbsp; &lsquo;You see how it is.&nbsp; To-night we have
broken the arrangement that you should never come here; and this
is the result.&nbsp; Will it offend you if&mdash;I ask you to
leave?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not in the least.&nbsp; Upon the whole, I prefer the
comfort of my little cabin and homestead to the gauntness and
alarms of this place.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There, now, I fear you are offended!&rsquo; she said, a
tear collecting in her eye.&nbsp; &lsquo;I wish I was going back
with you to the cabin!&nbsp; How happy we were, those three days
of our stay there!&nbsp; But it is better, perhaps, just now,
that you should leave me.&nbsp; Yes, these rooms are
oppressive.&nbsp; They require a large household to make them
cheerful. . . .&nbsp; Yet, Swithin,&rsquo; she added, after
reflection, &lsquo;I will not request you to go.&nbsp; Do as you
think best.&nbsp; I will light a night-light, and leave you here
to consider.&nbsp; For myself, I must go downstairs to my brother
at once, or he&rsquo;ll wonder what I am doing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She kindled the little light, and again retreated, closing the
door upon him.</p>
<p>Swithin stood and waited some time; till he considered that
upon the whole it would be preferable to leave.&nbsp; With this
intention he emerged and went softly along the dark passage
towards the extreme end, where there was a little crooked
staircase that would conduct him down to a disused side
door.&nbsp; Descending this stair he duly arrived at the other
side of the house, facing the quarter whence the wind blew, and
here he was surprised to catch the noise of rain beating against
the windows.&nbsp; It was a state of weather which fully
accounted for the visitor&rsquo;s impatient ringing.</p>
<p>St. Cleeve was in a minor kind of dilemma.&nbsp; The rain
reminded him that his hat and great-coat had been left
downstairs, in the front part of the house; and though he might
have gone home without either in ordinary weather it was not a
pleasant feat in the pelting winter rain.&nbsp; Retracing his
steps to Viviette&rsquo;s room he took the light, and opened a
closet-door that he had seen ajar on his way down.&nbsp; Within
the closet hung various articles of apparel, upholstery lumber of
all kinds filling the back part.&nbsp; Swithin thought he might
find here a cloak of hers to throw round him, but finally took
down from a peg a more suitable garment, the only one of the sort
that was there.&nbsp; It was an old moth-eaten great-coat,
heavily trimmed with fur; and in removing it a companion cap of
sealskin was disclosed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whose can they be?&rsquo; he thought, and a gloomy
answer suggested itself.&nbsp; &lsquo;Pooh,&rsquo; he then said
(summoning the scientific side of his nature), &lsquo;matter is
matter, and mental association only a delusion.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Putting on the garments he returned the light to Lady
Constantine&rsquo;s bedroom, and again prepared to depart as
before.</p>
<p>Scarcely, however, had he regained the corridor a second time,
when he heard a light footstep&mdash;seemingly
Viviette&rsquo;s&mdash;again on the front landing.&nbsp;
Wondering what she wanted with him further he waited, taking the
precaution to step into the closet till sure it was she.</p>
<p>The figure came onward, bent to the keyhole of the bedroom
door, and whispered (supposing him still inside), &lsquo;Swithin,
on second thoughts I think you may stay with safety.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Having no further doubt of her personality he came out with
thoughtless abruptness from the closet behind her, and looking
round suddenly she beheld his shadowy fur-clad outline.&nbsp; At
once she raised her hands in horror, as if to protect herself
from him; she uttered a shriek, and turned shudderingly to the
wall, covering her face.</p>
<p>Swithin would have picked her up in a moment, but by this time
he could hear footsteps rushing upstairs, in response to her
cry.&nbsp; In consternation, and with a view of not compromising
her, he effected his retreat as fast as possible, reaching the
bend of the corridor just as her brother Louis appeared with a
light at the other extremity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, for heaven&rsquo;s sake,
Viviette?&rsquo; said Louis.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My husband!&rsquo; she involuntarily exclaimed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What nonsense!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes, it is nonsense,&rsquo; she added, with an
effort.&nbsp; &lsquo;It was nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But what was the cause of your cry?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She had by this time recovered her reason and judgment.&nbsp;
&lsquo;O, it was a trick of the imagination,&rsquo; she said,
with a faint laugh.&nbsp; &lsquo;I live so much alone that I get
superstitious&mdash;and&mdash;I thought for the moment I saw an
apparition.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of your late husband?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; But it was nothing; it was the outline of
the&mdash;tall clock and the chair behind.&nbsp; Would you mind
going down, and leaving me to go into my room for a
moment?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She entered the bedroom, and her brother went
downstairs.&nbsp; Swithin thought it best to leave well alone,
and going noiselessly out of the house plodded through the rain
homeward.&nbsp; It was plain that agitations of one sort and
another had so weakened Viviette&rsquo;s nerves as to lay her
open to every impression.&nbsp; That the clothes he had borrowed
were some cast-off garments of the late Sir Blount had occurred
to St. Cleeve in taking them; but in the moment of returning to
her side he had forgotten this, and the shape they gave to his
figure had obviously been a reminder of too sudden a sort for
her.&nbsp; Musing thus he walked along as if he were still, as
before, the lonely student, dissociated from all mankind, and
with no shadow of right or interest in Welland House or its
mistress.</p>
<p>The great-coat and cap were unpleasant companions; but Swithin
having been reared, or having reared himself, in the scientific
school of thought, would not give way to his sense of their
weirdness.&nbsp; To do so would have been treason to his own
beliefs and aims.</p>
<p>When nearly home, at a point where his track converged on
another path, there approached him from the latter a group of
indistinct forms.&nbsp; The tones of their speech revealed them
to be Hezzy Biles, Nat Chapman, Fry, and other labourers.&nbsp;
Swithin was about to say a word to them, till recollecting his
disguise he deemed it advisable to hold his tongue, lest his
attire should tell a too dangerous tale as to where he had come
from.&nbsp; By degrees they drew closer, their walk being in the
same direction.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good-night, strainger,&rsquo; said Nat.</p>
<p>The stranger did not reply.</p>
<p>All of them paced on abreast of him, and he could perceive in
the gloom that their faces were turned inquiringly upon his
form.&nbsp; Then a whisper passed from one to another of them;
then Chapman, who was the boldest, dropped immediately behind his
heels, and followed there for some distance, taking close
observations of his outline, after which the men grouped again
and whispered.&nbsp; Thinking it best to let them pass on Swithin
slackened his pace, and they went ahead of him, apparently
without much reluctance.</p>
<p>There was no doubt that they had been impressed by the clothes
he wore; and having no wish to provoke similar comments from his
grandmother and Hannah, Swithin took the precaution, on arriving
at Welland Bottom, to enter the homestead by the outhouse.&nbsp;
Here he deposited the cap and coat in secure hiding, afterwards
going round to the front and opening the door in the usual
way.</p>
<p>In the entry he met Hannah, who said&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only to hear what have been seed to-night, Mr.
Swithin!&nbsp; The work-folk have dropped in to tell
us!&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the kitchen were the men who had outstripped him on the
road.&nbsp; Their countenances, instead of wearing the usual
knotty irregularities, had a smoothed-out expression of blank
concern.&nbsp; Swithin&rsquo;s entrance was unobtrusive and
quiet, as if he had merely come down from his study upstairs, and
they only noticed him by enlarging their gaze, so as to include
him in the audience.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We was in a deep talk at the moment,&rsquo; continued
Blore, &lsquo;and Natty had just brought up that story about old
Jeremiah Paddock&rsquo;s crossing the park one night at one
o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and seeing Sir Blount a-shutting my
lady out-o&rsquo;-doors; and we was saying that it seemed a true
return that he should perish in a foreign land; when we happened
to look up, and there was Sir Blount a-walking along.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did it overtake you, or did you overtake it?&rsquo;
whispered Hannah sepulchrally.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t say &rsquo;twas <i>it</i>,&rsquo;
returned Sammy.&nbsp; &lsquo;God forbid that I should drag in a
resurrection word about what perhaps was still solid manhood, and
has to die!&nbsp; But he, or it, closed in upon us, as
&rsquo;twere.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, closed in upon us!&rsquo; said Haymoss.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I said &ldquo;Good-night, strainger,&rdquo;&rsquo;
added Chapman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, &ldquo;Good-night, strainger,&rdquo;&mdash;that
wez yer words, Natty.&nbsp; I support ye in it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And then he closed in upon us still more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We closed in upon he, rather,&rsquo; said Chapman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, well; &rsquo;tis the same thing in such
matters!&nbsp; And the form was Sir Blount&rsquo;s.&nbsp; My
nostrils told me, for&mdash;there, &rsquo;a smelled.&nbsp; Yes, I
could smell&rsquo;n, being to leeward.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lord, lord, what unwholesome scandal&rsquo;s this about
the ghost of a respectable gentleman?&rsquo; said Mrs. Martin,
who had entered from the sitting-room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, wait, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t say
&rsquo;twere a low smell, mind ye.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twere a high
smell, a sort of gamey flaviour, calling to mind venison and
hare, just as you&rsquo;d expect of a great squire,&mdash;not
like a poor man&rsquo;s &rsquo;natomy, at all; and that was what
strengthened my faith that &rsquo;twas Sir Blount.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(&lsquo;The skins that old coat was made of,&rsquo; ruminated
Swithin.)</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, well; I&rsquo;ve not held out against the figure
o&rsquo; starvation these five-and-twenty year, on nine shillings
a week, to be afeard of a walking vapour, sweet or
savoury,&rsquo; said Hezzy.&nbsp; &lsquo;So here&rsquo;s
home-along.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bide a bit longer, and I&rsquo;m going too,&rsquo;
continued Fry.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, when I found &rsquo;twas Sir
Blount my spet dried up within my mouth; for neither hedge nor
bush were there for refuge against any foul spring &rsquo;a might
have made at us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Twas very curious; but we had likewise
a-mentioned his name just afore, in talking of the confirmation
that&rsquo;s shortly coming on,&rsquo; said Hezzy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is there soon to be a confirmation?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; In this parish&mdash;the first time in
Welland church for twenty years.&nbsp; As I say, I had told
&rsquo;em that he was confirmed the same year that I went up to
have it done, as I have very good cause to mind.&nbsp; When we
went to be examined, the pa&rsquo;son said to me, &ldquo;Rehearse
the articles of thy belief.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Blount (as he was
then) was nighest me, and he whispered, &ldquo;Women and
wine.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Women and wine,&rdquo; says I to the
pa&rsquo;son: and for that I was sent back till next
confirmation, Sir Blount never owning that he was the
rascal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Confirmation was a sight different at that time,&rsquo;
mused Biles.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Bishops didn&rsquo;t lay it on so
strong then as they do now.&nbsp; Now-a-days, yer Bishop gies
both hands to every Jack-rag and Tom-straw that drops the knee
afore him; but &rsquo;twas six chaps to one blessing when we was
boys.&nbsp; The Bishop o&rsquo; that time would stretch out his
palms and run his fingers over our row of crowns as off-hand as a
bank gentleman telling money.&nbsp; The great lords of the Church
in them days wasn&rsquo;t particular to a soul or two more or
less; and, for my part, I think living was easier for
&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The new Bishop, I hear, is a bachelor-man; or a widow
gentleman is it?&rsquo; asked Mrs. Martin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bachelor, I believe, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; Mr. San Cleeve,
making so bold, you&rsquo;ve never faced him yet, I
think?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Martin shook her head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; it was a piece of neglect.&nbsp; I hardly know how
it happened,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am going to, this time,&rsquo; said Swithin, and
turned the chat to other matters.</p>
<h3>XXIII</h3>
<p>Swithin could not sleep that night for thinking of his
Viviette.&nbsp; Nothing told so significantly of the conduct of
her first husband towards the poor lady as the abiding dread of
him which was revealed in her by any sudden revival of his image
or memory.&nbsp; But for that consideration her almost childlike
terror at Swithin&rsquo;s inadvertent disguise would have been
ludicrous.</p>
<p>He waited anxiously through several following days for an
opportunity of seeing her, but none was afforded.&nbsp; Her
brother&rsquo;s presence in the house sufficiently accounted for
this.&nbsp; At length he ventured to write a note, requesting her
to signal to him in a way she had done once or twice
before,&mdash;by pulling down a blind in a particular window of
the house, one of the few visible from the top of the Rings-Hill
column; this to be done on any evening when she could see him
after dinner on the terrace.</p>
<p>When he had levelled the glass at that window for five
successive nights he beheld the blind in the position
suggested.&nbsp; Three hours later, quite in the dusk, he
repaired to the place of appointment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My brother is away this evening,&rsquo; she explained,
&lsquo;and that&rsquo;s why I can come out.&nbsp; He is only gone
for a few hours, nor is he likely to go for longer just
yet.&nbsp; He keeps himself a good deal in my company, which has
made it unsafe for me to venture near you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Has he any suspicion?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;None, apparently.&nbsp; But he rather depresses
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How, Viviette?&rsquo;&nbsp; Swithin feared, from her
manner, that this was something serious.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would rather not tell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But&mdash;Well, never mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Swithin, I will tell you.&nbsp; There should be no
secrets between us.&nbsp; He urges upon me the necessity of
marrying, day after day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For money and position, of course.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; But I take no notice.&nbsp; I let him go
on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Really, this is sad!&rsquo; said the young man.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I must work harder than ever, or you will never be able to
own me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes, in good time!&rsquo; she cheeringly replied.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall be very glad to have you always near me.&nbsp;
I felt the gloom of our position keenly when I was obliged to
disappear that night, without assuring you it was only I who
stood there.&nbsp; Why were you so frightened at those old
clothes I borrowed?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t ask,&mdash;don&rsquo;t ask!&rsquo; she
said, burying her face on his shoulder.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
don&rsquo;t want to speak of that.&nbsp; There was something so
ghastly and so uncanny in your putting on such garments that I
wish you had been more thoughtful, and had left them
alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He assured her that he did not stop to consider whose they
were.&nbsp; &lsquo;By the way, they must be sent back,&rsquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; I never wish to see them again!&nbsp; I cannot help
feeling that your putting them on was ominous.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing is ominous in serene philosophy,&rsquo; he
said, kissing her.&nbsp; &lsquo;Things are either causes, or they
are not causes.&nbsp; When can you see me again?&rsquo;</p>
<p>In such wise the hour passed away.&nbsp; The evening was
typical of others which followed it at irregular intervals
through the winter.&nbsp; And during the intenser months of the
season frequent falls of snow lengthened, even more than other
difficulties had done, the periods of isolation between the
pair.&nbsp; Swithin adhered with all the more strictness to the
letter of his promise not to intrude into the house, from his
sense of her powerlessness to compel him to keep out should he
choose to rebel.&nbsp; A student of the greatest forces in
nature, he had, like many others of his sort, no personal force
to speak of in a social point of view, mainly because he took no
interest in human ranks and formulas; and hence he was as docile
as a child in her hands wherever matters of that kind were
concerned.</p>
<p>Her brother wintered at Welland; but whether because his
experience of tropic climes had unfitted him for the brumal
rigours of Britain, or for some other reason, he seldom showed
himself out of doors, and Swithin caught but passing glimpses of
him.&nbsp; Now and then Viviette&rsquo;s impulsive affection
would overcome her sense of risk, and she would press Swithin to
call on her at all costs.&nbsp; This he would by no means
do.&nbsp; It was obvious to his more logical mind that the
secrecy to which they had bound themselves must be kept in its
fulness, or might as well be abandoned altogether.</p>
<p>He was now sadly exercised on the subject of his uncle&rsquo;s
will.&nbsp; There had as yet been no pressing reasons for a full
and candid reply to the solicitor who had communicated with him,
owing to the fact that the payments were not to begin till
Swithin was one-and-twenty; but time was going on, and something
definite would have to be done soon.&nbsp; To own to his marriage
and consequent disqualification for the bequest was easy in
itself; but it involved telling at least one man what both
Viviette and himself had great reluctance in telling
anybody.&nbsp; Moreover he wished Viviette to know nothing of his
loss in making her his wife.&nbsp; All he could think of doing
for the present was to write a postponing letter to his
uncle&rsquo;s lawyer, and wait events.</p>
<p>The one comfort of this dreary winter-time was his perception
of a returning ability to work with the regularity and much of
the spirit of earlier days.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>One bright night in April there was an eclipse of the moon,
and Mr. Torkingham, by arrangement, brought to the observatory
several labouring men and boys, to whom he had promised a sight
of the phenomenon through the telescope.&nbsp; The coming
confirmation, fixed for May, was again talked of; and St. Cleeve
learnt from the parson that the Bishop had arranged to stay the
night at the vicarage, and was to be invited to a grand luncheon
at Welland House immediately after the ordinance.</p>
<p>This seemed like a going back into life again as regarded the
mistress of that house; and St. Cleeve was a little surprised
that, in his communications with Viviette, she had mentioned no
such probability.&nbsp; The next day he walked round the mansion,
wondering how in its present state any entertainment could be
given therein.</p>
<p>He found that the shutters had been opened, which had restored
an unexpected liveliness to the aspect of the windows.&nbsp; Two
men were putting a chimney-pot on one of the chimney-stacks, and
two more were scraping green mould from the front wall.&nbsp; He
made no inquiries on that occasion.&nbsp; Three days later he
strolled thitherward again.&nbsp; Now a great cleaning of
window-panes was going on, Hezzy Biles and Sammy Blore being the
operators, for which purpose their services must have been
borrowed from the neighbouring farmer.&nbsp; Hezzy dashed water
at the glass with a force that threatened to break it in, the
broad face of Sammy being discernible inside, smiling at the
onset.&nbsp; In addition to these, Anthony Green and another were
weeding the gravel walks, and putting fresh plants into the
flower-beds.&nbsp; Neither of these reasonable operations was a
great undertaking, singly looked at; but the life Viviette had
latterly led and the mood in which she had hitherto regarded the
premises, rendered it somewhat significant.&nbsp; Swithin,
however, was rather curious than concerned at the proceedings,
and returned to his tower with feelings of interest not entirely
confined to the worlds overhead.</p>
<p>Lady Constantine may or may not have seen him from the house;
but the same evening, which was fine and dry, while he was
occupying himself in the observatory with cleaning the eye-pieces
of the equatorial, skull-cap on head, observing-jacket on, and in
other ways primed for sweeping, the customary stealthy step on
the winding staircase brought her form in due course into the
rays of the bull&rsquo;s-eye lantern.&nbsp; The meeting was all
the more pleasant to him from being unexpected, and he at once
lit up a larger lamp in honour of the occasion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is but a hasty visit,&rsquo; she said when, after
putting up her mouth to be kissed, she had seated herself in the
low chair used for observations, panting a little with the labour
of ascent.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I hope to be able to come more freely
soon.&nbsp; My brother is still living on with me.&nbsp; Yes, he
is going to stay until the confirmation is over.&nbsp; After the
confirmation he will certainly leave.&nbsp; So good it is of you,
dear, to please me by agreeing to the ceremony.&nbsp; The Bishop,
you know, is going to lunch with us.&nbsp; It is a wonder he has
promised to come, for he is a man averse to society, and mostly
keeps entirely with the clergy on these confirmation tours, or
circuits, or whatever they call them.&nbsp; But Mr.
Torkingham&rsquo;s house is so very small, and mine is so close
at hand, that this arrangement to relieve him of the fuss of one
meal, at least, naturally suggested itself; and the Bishop has
fallen in with it very readily.&nbsp; How are you getting on with
your observations?&nbsp; Have you not wanted me dreadfully, to
write down notes?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I have been obliged to do without you, whether or
no.&nbsp; See here,&mdash;how much I have done.&rsquo;&nbsp; And
he showed her a book ruled in columns, headed
&lsquo;Object,&rsquo; &lsquo;Right Ascension,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Declination,&rsquo; &lsquo;Features,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Remarks,&rsquo; and so on.</p>
<p>She looked over this and other things, but her mind speedily
winged its way back to the confirmation.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is so
new to me,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;to have persons coming to the
house, that I feel rather anxious.&nbsp; I hope the luncheon will
be a success.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know the Bishop?&rsquo; said Swithin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have not seen him for many years.&nbsp; I knew him
when I was quite a girl, and he held the little living of
Puddle-sub-Mixen, near us; but after that time, and ever since I
have lived here, I have seen nothing of him.&nbsp; There has been
no confirmation in this village, they say, for twenty
years.&nbsp; The other bishop used to make the young men and
women go to Warborne; he wouldn&rsquo;t take the trouble to come
to such an out-of-the-way parish as ours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This cleaning and preparation that I observe going on
must be rather a tax upon you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My brother Louis sees to it, and, what is more, bears
the expense.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your brother?&rsquo; said Swithin, with surprise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, he insisted on doing so,&rsquo; she replied, in a
hesitating, despondent tone.&nbsp; &lsquo;He has been active in
the whole matter, and was the first to suggest the
invitation.&nbsp; I should not have thought of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I will hold aloof till it is all over.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thanks, dearest, for your considerateness.&nbsp; I wish
it was not still advisable!&nbsp; But I shall see you on the day,
and watch my own philosopher all through the service from the
corner of my pew! . . .&nbsp; I hope you are well prepared for
the rite, Swithin?&rsquo; she added, turning tenderly to
him.&nbsp; &lsquo;It would perhaps be advisable for you to give
up this astronomy till the confirmation is over, in order to
devote your attention exclusively to that more serious
matter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;More serious!&nbsp; Well, I will do the best I
can.&nbsp; I am sorry to see that you are less interested in
astronomy than you used to be, Viviette.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; it is only that these preparations for the Bishop
unsettle my mind from study.&nbsp; Now put on your other coat and
hat, and come with me a little way.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>XXIV</h3>
<p>The morning of the confirmation was come.&nbsp; It was mid-May
time, bringing with it weather not, perhaps, quite so blooming as
that assumed to be natural to the month by the joyous poets of
three hundred years ago; but a very tolerable, well-wearing May,
that the average rustic would willingly have compounded for in
lieu of Mays occasionally fairer, but usually more foul.</p>
<p>Among the larger shrubs and flowers which composed the
outworks of the Welland gardens, the lilac, the laburnum, and the
guelder-rose hung out their respective colours of purple, yellow,
and white; whilst within these, belted round from every
disturbing gale, rose the columbine, the peony, the larkspur, and
the Solomon&rsquo;s seal.&nbsp; The animate things that moved
amid this scene of colour were plodding bees, gadding
butterflies, and numerous sauntering young feminine candidates
for the impending confirmation, who, having gaily bedecked
themselves for the ceremony, were enjoying their own appearance
by walking about in twos and threes till it was time to
start.</p>
<p>Swithin St. Cleeve, whose preparations were somewhat simpler
than those of the village belles, waited till his grandmother and
Hannah had set out, and then, locking the door, followed towards
the distant church.&nbsp; On reaching the churchyard gate he met
Mr. Torkingham, who shook hands with him in the manner of a man
with several irons in the fire, and telling Swithin where to sit,
disappeared to hunt up some candidates who had not yet made
themselves visible.</p>
<p>Casting his eyes round for Viviette, and seeing nothing of
her, Swithin went on to the church porch, and looked in.&nbsp;
From the north side of the nave smiled a host of girls, gaily
uniform in dress, age, and a temporary repression of their
natural tendency to &lsquo;skip like a hare over the meshes of
good counsel.&rsquo;&nbsp; Their white muslin dresses, their
round white caps, from beneath whose borders hair-knots and curls
of various shades of brown escaped upon their low shoulders, as
if against their will, lighted up the dark pews and grey
stone-work to an unwonted warmth and life.&nbsp; On the south
side were the young men and boys,&mdash;heavy, angular, and
massive, as indeed was rather necessary, considering what they
would have to bear at the hands of wind and weather before they
returned to that mouldy nave for the last time.</p>
<p>Over the heads of all these he could see into the chancel to
the square pew on the north side, which was attached to Welland
House.&nbsp; There he discerned Lady Constantine already arrived,
her brother Louis sitting by her side.</p>
<p>Swithin entered and seated himself at the end of a bench, and
she, who had been on the watch, at once showed by subtle signs
her consciousness of the presence of the young man who had
reversed the ordained sequence of the Church services on her
account.&nbsp; She appeared in black attire, though not strictly
in mourning, a touch of red in her bonnet setting off the
richness of her complexion without making her gay.&nbsp;
Handsomest woman in the church she decidedly was; and yet a
disinterested spectator who had known all the circumstances would
probably have felt that, the future considered, Swithin&rsquo;s
more natural mate would have been one of the muslin-clad maidens
who were to be presented to the Bishop with him that day.</p>
<p>When the Bishop had arrived and gone into the chancel, and
blown his nose, the congregation were sufficiently impressed by
his presence to leave off looking at one another.</p>
<p>The Right Reverend Cuthbert Helmsdale, D.D., ninety-fourth
occupant of the episcopal throne of the diocese, revealed himself
to be a personage of dark complexion, whose darkness was thrown
still further into prominence by the lawn protuberances that now
rose upon his two shoulders like the Eastern and Western
hemispheres.&nbsp; In stature he seemed to be tall and imposing,
but something of this aspect may have been derived from his
robes.</p>
<p>The service was, as usual, of a length which severely tried
the tarrying powers of the young people assembled; and it was not
till the youth of all the other parishes had gone up that the
turn came for the Welland bevy.&nbsp; Swithin and some older ones
were nearly the last.&nbsp; When, at the heels of Mr. Torkingham,
he passed Lady Constantine&rsquo;s pew, he lifted his eyes from
the red lining of that gentleman&rsquo;s hood sufficiently high
to catch hers.&nbsp; She was abstracted, tearful, regarding him
with all the rapt mingling of religion, love, fervour, and hope
which such women can feel at such times, and which men know
nothing of.&nbsp; How fervidly she watched the Bishop place his
hand on her beloved youth&rsquo;s head; how she saw the great
episcopal ring glistening in the sun among Swithin&rsquo;s brown
curls; how she waited to hear if Dr. Helmsdale uttered the form
&lsquo;this thy child&rsquo; which he used for the younger ones,
or &lsquo;this thy servant&rsquo; which he used for those older;
and how, when he said, &lsquo;this thy <i>child</i>,&rsquo; she
felt a prick of conscience, like a person who had entrapped an
innocent youth into marriage for her own gratification, till she
remembered that she had raised his social position
thereby,&mdash;all this could only have been told in its entirety
by herself.</p>
<p>As for Swithin, he felt ashamed of his own utter lack of the
high enthusiasm which beamed so eloquently from her eyes.&nbsp;
When he passed her again, on the return journey from the Bishop
to his seat, her face was warm with a blush which her brother
might have observed had he regarded her.</p>
<p>Whether he had observed it or not, as soon as St. Cleeve had
sat himself down again Louis Glanville turned and looked hard at
the young astronomer.&nbsp; This was the first time that St.
Cleeve and Viviette&rsquo;s brother had been face to face in a
distinct light, their first meeting having occurred in the dusk
of a railway-station.&nbsp; Swithin was not in the habit of
noticing people&rsquo;s features; he scarcely ever observed any
detail of physiognomy in his friends, a generalization from their
whole aspect forming his idea of them; and he now only noted a
young man of perhaps thirty, who lolled a good deal, and in whose
small dark eyes seemed to be concentrated the activity that the
rest of his frame decidedly lacked.&nbsp; This gentleman&rsquo;s
eyes were henceforward, to the end of the service, continually
fixed upon Swithin; but as this was their natural direction, from
the position of his seat, there was no great strangeness in the
circumstance.</p>
<p>Swithin wanted to say to Viviette, &lsquo;Now I hope you are
pleased; I have conformed to your ideas of my duty, leaving my
fitness out of consideration;&rsquo; but as he could only see her
bonnet and forehead it was not possible even to look the
intelligence.&nbsp; He turned to his left hand, where the organ
stood, with Miss Tabitha Lark seated behind it.</p>
<p>It being now sermon-time the youthful blower had fallen asleep
over the handle of his bellows, and Tabitha pulled out her
handkerchief intending to flap him awake with it.&nbsp; With the
handkerchief tumbled out a whole family of unexpected articles: a
silver thimble; a photograph; a little purse; a scent-bottle;
some loose halfpence; nine green gooseberries; a key.&nbsp; They
rolled to Swithin&rsquo;s feet, and, passively obeying his first
instinct, he picked up as many of the articles as he could find,
and handed them to her amid the smiles of the neighbours.</p>
<p>Tabitha was half-dead with humiliation at such an event,
happening under the very eyes of the Bishop on this glorious
occasion; she turned pale as a sheet, and could hardly keep her
seat.&nbsp; Fearing she might faint, Swithin, who had genuinely
sympathized, bent over and whispered encouragingly,
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t mind it, Tabitha.&nbsp; Shall I take you out
into the air?&rsquo;&nbsp; She declined his offer, and presently
the sermon came to an end.</p>
<p>Swithin lingered behind the rest of the congregation
sufficiently long to see Lady Constantine, accompanied by her
brother, the Bishop, the Bishop&rsquo;s chaplain, Mr. Torkingham,
and several other clergy and ladies, enter to the grand luncheon
by the door which admitted from the churchyard to the lawn of
Welland House; the whole group talking with a vivacity all the
more intense, as it seemed, from the recent two hours&rsquo;
enforced repression of their social qualities within the
adjoining building.</p>
<p>The young man stood till he was left quite alone in the
churchyard, and then went slowly homeward over the hill, perhaps
a trifle depressed at the impossibility of being near Viviette in
this her one day of gaiety, and joining in the conversation of
those who surrounded her.</p>
<p>Not that he felt much jealousy of her situation, as his wife,
in comparison with his own.&nbsp; He had so clearly understood
from the beginning that, in the event of marriage, their outward
lives were to run on as before, that to rebel now would have been
unmanly in himself and cruel to her, by adding to embarrassments
that were great enough already.&nbsp; His momentary doubt was of
his own strength to achieve sufficiently high things to render
him, in relation to her, other than a patronized young favourite,
whom she had married at an immense sacrifice of position.&nbsp;
Now, at twenty, he was doomed to isolation even from a wife;
could it be that at, say thirty, he would be welcomed
everywhere?</p>
<p>But with motion through the sun and air his mood assumed a
lighter complexion, and on reaching home he remembered with
interest that Venus was in a favourable aspect for observation
that afternoon.</p>
<h3>XXV</h3>
<p>Meanwhile the interior of Welland House was rattling with the
progress of the ecclesiastical luncheon.</p>
<p>The Bishop, who sat at Lady Constantine&rsquo;s side, seemed
enchanted with her company, and from the beginning she engrossed
his attention almost entirely.&nbsp; The truth was that the
circumstance of her not having her whole soul centred on the
success of the repast and the pleasure of Bishop Helmsdale,
imparted to her, in a great measure, the mood to ensure
both.&nbsp; Her brother Louis it was who had laid out the plan of
entertaining the Bishop, to which she had assented but
indifferently.&nbsp; She was secretly bound to another, on whose
career she had staked all her happiness.&nbsp; Having thus other
interests she evinced to-day the ease of one who hazards nothing,
and there was no sign of that preoccupation with housewifely
contingencies which so often makes the hostess hardly
recognizable as the charming woman who graced a friend&rsquo;s
home the day before.&nbsp; In marrying Swithin Lady Constantine
had played her card,&mdash;recklessly, impulsively, ruinously,
perhaps; but she had played it; it could not be withdrawn; and
she took this morning&rsquo;s luncheon as an episode that could
result in nothing to her beyond the day&rsquo;s
entertainment.</p>
<p>Hence, by that power of indirectness to accomplish in an hour
what strenuous aiming will not effect in a life-time, she
fascinated the Bishop to an unprecedented degree.&nbsp; A
bachelor, he rejoiced in the commanding period of life that
stretches between the time of waning impulse and the time of
incipient dotage, when a woman can reach the male heart neither
by awakening a young man&rsquo;s passion nor an old man&rsquo;s
infatuation.&nbsp; He must be made to admire, or he can be made
to do nothing.&nbsp; Unintentionally that is how Viviette
operated on her guest.</p>
<p>Lady Constantine, to external view, was in a position to
desire many things, and of a sort to desire them.&nbsp; She was
obviously, by nature, impulsive to indiscretion.&nbsp; But
instead of exhibiting activities to correspond, recently
gratified affection lent to her manner just now a sweet serenity,
a truly Christian contentment, which it puzzled the learned
Bishop exceedingly to find in a warm young widow, and increased
his interest in her every moment.&nbsp; Thus matters stood when
the conversation veered round to the morning&rsquo;s
confirmation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That was a singularly engaging young man who came up
among Mr. Torkingham&rsquo;s candidates,&rsquo; said the Bishop
to her somewhat abruptly.</p>
<p>But abruptness does not catch a woman without her wit.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Which one?&rsquo; she said innocently.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That youth with the &ldquo;corn-coloured&rdquo; hair,
as a poet of the new school would call it, who sat just at the
side of the organ.&nbsp; Do you know who he is?&rsquo;</p>
<p>In answering Viviette showed a little nervousness, for the
first time that day.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes.&nbsp; He is the son of an unfortunate gentleman
who was formerly curate here,&mdash;a Mr. St. Cleeve.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never saw a handsomer young man in my life,&rsquo;
said the Bishop.&nbsp; Lady Constantine blushed.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There was a lack of self-consciousness, too, in his manner
of presenting himself, which very much won me.&nbsp; A Mr. St.
Cleeve, do you say?&nbsp; A curate&rsquo;s son?&nbsp; His father
must have been St. Cleeve of All Angels, whom I knew.&nbsp; How
comes he to be staying on here?&nbsp; What is he
doing?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Torkingham, who kept one ear on the Bishop all the
lunch-time, finding that Lady Constantine was not ready with an
answer, hastened to reply: &lsquo;Your lordship is right.&nbsp;
His father was an All Angels&rsquo; man.&nbsp; The youth is
rather to be pitied.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He was a man of talent,&rsquo; affirmed the
Bishop.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I quite lost sight of him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He was curate to the late vicar,&rsquo; resumed the
parson, &lsquo;and was much liked by the parish: but, being
erratic in his tastes and tendencies, he rashly contracted a
marriage with the daughter of a farmer, and then quarrelled with
the local gentry for not taking up his wife.&nbsp; This lad was
an only child.&nbsp; There was enough money to educate him, and
he is sufficiently well provided for to be independent of the
world so long as he is content to live here with great
economy.&nbsp; But of course this gives him few opportunities of
bettering himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, naturally,&rsquo; replied the Bishop of
Melchester.&nbsp; &lsquo;Better have been left entirely dependent
on himself.&nbsp; These half-incomes do men little good, unless
they happen to be either weaklings or geniuses.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lady Constantine would have given the world to say, &lsquo;He
is a genius, and the hope of my life;&rsquo; but it would have
been decidedly risky, and in another moment was unnecessary, for
Mr. Torkingham said, &lsquo;There is a certain genius in this
young man, I sometimes think.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, he really looks quite out of the common,&rsquo;
said the Bishop.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Youthful genius is sometimes disappointing,&rsquo;
observed Viviette, not believing it in the least.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the Bishop.&nbsp; &lsquo;Though it
depends, Lady Constantine, on what you understand by
disappointing.&nbsp; It may produce nothing visible to the
world&rsquo;s eye, and yet may complete its development within to
a very perfect degree.&nbsp; Objective achievements, though the
only ones which are counted, are not the only ones that exist and
have value; and I for one should be sorry to assert that, because
a man of genius dies as unknown to the world as when he was born,
he therefore was an instance of wasted material.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Objective achievements were, however, those that Lady
Constantine had a weakness for in the present case, and she asked
her more experienced guest if he thought early development of a
special talent a good sign in youth.</p>
<p>The Bishop thought it well that a particular bent should not
show itself too early, lest disgust should result.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Still,&rsquo; argued Lady Constantine rather firmly
(for she felt this opinion of the Bishop&rsquo;s to be one
throwing doubt on Swithin), &lsquo;sustained fruition is
compatible with early bias.&nbsp; Tycho Brahe showed quite a
passion for the solar system when he was but a youth, and so did
Kepler; and James Ferguson had a surprising knowledge of the
stars by the time he was eleven or twelve.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; sustained fruition,&rsquo; conceded the Bishop
(rather liking the words), &lsquo;is certainly compatible with
early bias.&nbsp; Fenelon preached at fourteen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&mdash;Mr. St. Cleeve&mdash;is not in the
church,&rsquo; said Lady Constantine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is a scientific young man, my lord,&rsquo; explained
Mr. Torkingham.</p>
<p>&lsquo;An astronomer,&rsquo; she added, with suppressed
pride.</p>
<p>&lsquo;An astronomer!&nbsp; Really, that makes him still more
interesting than being handsome and the son of a man I
knew.&nbsp; How and where does he study astronomy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He has a beautiful observatory.&nbsp; He has made use
of an old column that was erected on this manor to the memory of
one of the Constantines.&nbsp; It has been very ingeniously
adapted for his purpose, and he does very good work there.&nbsp;
I believe he occasionally sends up a paper to the Royal Society,
or Greenwich, or somewhere, and to astronomical
periodicals.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should have had no idea, from his boyish look, that
he had advanced so far,&rsquo; the Bishop answered.&nbsp;
&lsquo;And yet I saw on his face that within there was a book
worth studying.&nbsp; His is a career I should very much like to
watch.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A thrill of pleasure chased through Lady Constantine&rsquo;s
heart at this praise of her chosen one.&nbsp; It was an unwitting
compliment to her taste and discernment in singling him out for
her own, despite its temporary inexpediency.</p>
<p>Her brother Louis now spoke.&nbsp; &lsquo;I fancy he is as
interested in one of his fellow-creatures as in the science of
astronomy,&rsquo; observed the cynic dryly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In whom?&rsquo; said Lady Constantine quickly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the fair maiden who sat at the organ,&mdash;a pretty
girl, rather.&nbsp; I noticed a sort of by-play going on between
them occasionally, during the sermon, which meant mating, if I am
not mistaken.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She!&rsquo; said Lady Constantine.&nbsp; &lsquo;She is
only a village girl, a dairyman&rsquo;s daughter,&mdash;Tabitha
Lark, who used to come to read to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She may be a savage, for all that I know: but there is
something between those two young people,
nevertheless.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Bishop looked as if he had allowed his interest in a
stranger to carry him too far, and Mr. Torkingham was horrified
at the irreverent and easy familiarity of Louis Glanville&rsquo;s
talk in the presence of a consecrated bishop.&nbsp; As for
Viviette, her tongue lost all its volubility.&nbsp; She felt
quite faint at heart, and hardly knew how to control herself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have never noticed anything of the sort,&rsquo; said
Mr. Torkingham.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It would be a matter for regret,&rsquo; said the
Bishop, &lsquo;if he should follow his father in forming an
attachment that would be a hindrance to him in any honourable
career; though perhaps an early marriage, intrinsically
considered, would not be bad for him.&nbsp; A youth who looks as
if he had come straight from old Greece may be exposed to many
temptations, should he go out into the world without a friend or
counsellor to guide him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Despite her sudden jealousy Viviette&rsquo;s eyes grew moist
at the picture of her innocent Swithin going into the world
without a friend or counsellor.&nbsp; But she was sick in soul
and disquieted still by Louis&rsquo;s dreadful remarks, who,
unbeliever as he was in human virtue, could have no reason
whatever for representing Swithin as engaged in a private love
affair if such were not his honest impression.</p>
<p>She was so absorbed during the remainder of the luncheon that
she did not even observe the kindly light that her presence was
shedding on the right reverend ecclesiastic by her side.&nbsp; He
reflected it back in tones duly mellowed by his position; the
minor clergy caught up the rays thereof, and so the gentle
influence played down the table.</p>
<p>The company soon departed when luncheon was over, and the
remainder of the day passed in quietness, the Bishop being
occupied in his room at the vicarage with writing letters or a
sermon.&nbsp; Having a long journey before him the next day he
had expressed a wish to be housed for the night without ceremony,
and would have dined alone with Mr. Torkingham but that, by a
happy thought, Lady Constantine and her brother were asked to
join them.</p>
<p>However, when Louis crossed the churchyard and entered the
vicarage drawing-room at seven o&rsquo;clock, his sister was not
in his company.&nbsp; She was, he said, suffering from a slight
headache, and much regretted that she was on that account unable
to come.&nbsp; At this intelligence the social sparkle
disappeared from the Bishop&rsquo;s eye, and he sat down to
table, endeavouring to mould into the form of episcopal serenity
an expression which was really one of common human
disappointment.</p>
<p>In his simple statement Louis Glanville had by no means
expressed all the circumstances which accompanied his
sister&rsquo;s refusal, at the last moment, to dine at her
neighbour&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; Louis had strongly urged her to
bear up against her slight indisposition&mdash;if it were that,
and not disinclination&mdash;and come along with him on just this
one occasion, perhaps a more important episode in her life than
she was aware of.&nbsp; Viviette thereupon knew quite well that
he alluded to the favourable impression she was producing on the
Bishop, notwithstanding that neither of them mentioned the
Bishop&rsquo;s name.&nbsp; But she did not give way, though the
argument waxed strong between them; and Louis left her in no very
amiable mood, saying, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you have any
more headache than I have, Viviette.&nbsp; It is some provoking
whim of yours&mdash;nothing more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In this there was a substratum of truth.&nbsp; When her
brother had left her, and she had seen him from the window
entering the vicarage gate, Viviette seemed to be much relieved,
and sat down in her bedroom till the evening grew dark, and only
the lights shining through the trees from the parsonage
dining-room revealed to the eye where that dwelling stood.&nbsp;
Then she arose, and putting on the cloak she had used so many
times before for the same purpose, she locked her bedroom door
(to be supposed within, in case of the accidental approach of a
servant), and let herself privately out of the house.</p>
<p>Lady Constantine paused for a moment under the vicarage
windows, till she could sufficiently well hear the voices of the
diners to be sure that they were actually within, and then went
on her way, which was towards the Rings-Hill column.&nbsp; She
appeared a mere spot, hardly distinguishable from the grass, as
she crossed the open ground, and soon became absorbed in the
black mass of the fir plantation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the conversation at Mr. Torkingham&rsquo;s
dinner-table was not of a highly exhilarating quality.&nbsp; The
parson, in long self-communing during the afternoon, had decided
that the Diocesan Synod, whose annual session at Melchester had
occurred in the month previous, would afford a solid and
unimpeachable subject to launch during the meal, whenever
conversation flagged; and that it would be one likely to win the
respect of his spiritual chieftain for himself as the
introducer.&nbsp; Accordingly, in the further belief that you
could not have too much of a good thing, Mr. Torkingham not only
acted upon his idea, but at every pause rallied to the synod
point with unbroken firmness.&nbsp; Everything which had been
discussed at that last session&mdash;such as the introduction of
the lay element into the councils of the church, the
reconstitution of the ecclesiastical courts, church patronage,
the tithe question&mdash;was revived by Mr. Torkingham, and the
excellent remarks which the Bishop had made in his addresses on
those subjects were quoted back to him.</p>
<p>As for Bishop Helmsdale himself, his instincts seemed to be to
allude in a debonair spirit to the incidents of the past
day&mdash;to the flowers in Lady Constantine&rsquo;s beds, the
date of her house&mdash;perhaps with a view of hearing a little
more about their owner from Louis, who would very readily have
followed the Bishop&rsquo;s lead had the parson allowed him
room.&nbsp; But this Mr. Torkingham seldom did, and about
half-past nine they prepared to separate.</p>
<p>Louis Glanville had risen from the table, and was standing by
the window, looking out upon the sky, and privately yawning, the
topics discussed having been hardly in his line.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A fine night,&rsquo; he said at last.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose our young astronomer is hard at work
now,&rsquo; said the Bishop, following the direction of
Louis&rsquo;s glance towards the clear sky.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the parson; &lsquo;he is very
assiduous whenever the nights are good for observation.&nbsp; I
have occasionally joined him in his tower, and looked through his
telescope with great benefit to my ideas of celestial
phenomena.&nbsp; I have not seen what he has been doing
lately.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Suppose we stroll that way?&rsquo; said Louis.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Would you be interested in seeing the observatory,
Bishop?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am quite willing to go,&rsquo; said the Bishop,
&lsquo;if the distance is not too great.&nbsp; I should not be at
all averse to making the acquaintance of so exceptional a young
man as this Mr. St. Cleeve seems to be; and I have never seen the
inside of an observatory in my life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The intention was no sooner formed than it was carried out,
Mr. Torkingham leading the way.</p>
<h3>XXVI</h3>
<p>Half an hour before this time Swithin St. Cleeve had been
sitting in his cabin at the base of the column, working out some
figures from observations taken on preceding nights, with a view
to a theory that he had in his head on the motions of certain
so-called fixed stars.</p>
<p>The evening being a little chilly a small fire was burning in
the stove, and this and the shaded lamp before him lent a
remarkably cosy air to the chamber.&nbsp; He was awakened from
his reveries by a scratching at the window-pane like that of the
point of an ivy leaf, which he knew to be really caused by the
tip of his sweetheart-wife&rsquo;s forefinger.&nbsp; He rose and
opened the door to admit her, not without astonishment as to how
she had been able to get away from her friends.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dearest Viv, why, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; he
said, perceiving that her face, as the lamplight fell on it, was
sad, and even stormy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought I would run across to see you.&nbsp; I have
heard something so&mdash;so&mdash;to your discredit, and I know
it can&rsquo;t be true!&nbsp; I know you are constancy itself;
but your constancy produces strange effects in people&rsquo;s
eyes!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good heavens!&nbsp; Nobody has found us
out&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no&mdash;it is not that.&nbsp; You know, Swithin,
that I am always sincere, and willing to own if I am to blame in
anything.&nbsp; Now will you prove to me that you are the same by
owning some fault to me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, dear, indeed; directly I can think of one worth
owning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wonder one does not rush upon your tongue in a
moment!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I confess that I am sufficiently a Pharisee not to
experience that spontaneity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Swithin, don&rsquo;t speak so affectedly, when you know
so well what I mean!&nbsp; Is it nothing to you that, after all
our vows for life, you have thought it right to&mdash;flirt with
a village girl?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Viviette!&rsquo; interrupted Swithin, taking her
hand, which was hot and trembling.&nbsp; &lsquo;You who are full
of noble and generous feelings, and regard me with devoted
tenderness that has never been surpassed by woman,&mdash;how can
you be so greatly at fault?&nbsp; <i>I</i> flirt, Viviette?&nbsp;
By thinking that you injure yourself in my eyes.&nbsp; Why, I am
so far from doing so that I continually pull myself up for
watching you too jealously, as to-day, when I have been dreading
the effect upon you of other company in my absence, and thinking
that you rather shut the gates against me when you have big-wigs
to entertain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you, Swithin?&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp; It was evident
that the honest tone of his words was having a great effect in
clearing away the clouds.&nbsp; She added with an uncertain
smile, &lsquo;But how can I believe that, after what was seen
to-day?&nbsp; My brother, not knowing in the least that I had an
iota of interest in you, told me that he witnessed the signs of
an attachment between you and Tabitha Lark in church, this
morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; cried Swithin, with a burst of
laughter.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now I know what you mean, and what has
caused this misunderstanding!&nbsp; How good of you, Viviette, to
come at once and have it out with me, instead of brooding over it
with dark imaginings, and thinking bitter things of me, as many
women would have done!&rsquo;&nbsp; He succinctly told the whole
story of his little adventure with Tabitha that morning; and the
sky was clear on both sides.&nbsp; &lsquo;When shall I be able to
claim you,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;and put an end to all such
painful accidents as these?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She partially sighed.&nbsp; Her perception of what the outside
world was made of, latterly somewhat obscured by solitude and her
lover&rsquo;s company, had been revived to-day by her
entertainment of the Bishop, clergymen, and, more particularly,
clergymen&rsquo;s wives; and it did not diminish her sense of the
difficulties in Swithin&rsquo;s path to see anew how little was
thought of the greatest gifts, mental and spiritual, if they were
not backed up by substantial temporalities.&nbsp; However, the
pair made the best of their future that circumstances permitted,
and the interview was at length drawing to a close when there
came, without the slightest forewarning, a smart rat-tat-tat upon
the little door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O I am lost!&rsquo; said Viviette, seizing his
arm.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why was I so incautious?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is nobody of consequence,&rsquo; whispered Swithin
assuringly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Somebody from my grandmother, probably,
to know when I am coming home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They were unperceived so far, for the only window which gave
light to the hut was screened by a curtain.&nbsp; At that moment
they heard the sound of their visitors&rsquo; voices, and, with a
consternation as great as her own, Swithin discerned the tones of
Mr. Torkingham and the Bishop of Melchester.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where shall I get?&nbsp; What shall I do?&rsquo; said
the poor lady, clasping her hands.</p>
<p>Swithin looked around the cabin, and a very little look was
required to take in all its resources.&nbsp; At one end, as
previously explained, were a table, stove, chair, cupboard, and
so on; while the other was completely occupied by a diminutive
Arabian bedstead, hung with curtains of pink-and-white
chintz.&nbsp; On the inside of the bed there was a narrow
channel, about a foot wide, between it and the wall of the
hut.&nbsp; Into this cramped retreat Viviette slid herself, and
stood trembling behind the curtains.</p>
<p>By this time the knock had been repeated more loudly, the
light through the window-blind unhappily revealing the presence
of some inmate.&nbsp; Swithin threw open the door, and Mr.
Torkingham introduced his visitors.</p>
<p>The Bishop shook hands with the young man, told him he had
known his father, and at Swithin&rsquo;s invitation, weak as it
was, entered the cabin, the vicar and Louis Glanville remaining
on the threshold, not to inconveniently crowd the limited space
within.</p>
<p>Bishop Helmsdale looked benignantly around the apartment, and
said, &lsquo;Quite a settlement in the backwoods&mdash;quite: far
enough from the world to afford the votary of science the
seclusion he needs, and not so far as to limit his
resources.&nbsp; A hermit might apparently live here in as much
solitude as in a primeval forest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;His lordship has been good enough to express an
interest in your studies,&rsquo; said Mr. Torkingham to St.
Cleeve.&nbsp; &lsquo;And we have come to ask you to let us see
the observatory.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;With great pleasure,&rsquo; stammered Swithin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where is the observatory?&rsquo; inquired the Bishop,
peering round again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The staircase is just outside this door,&rsquo; Swithin
answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am at your lordship&rsquo;s service, and
will show you up at once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And this is your little bed, for use when you work
late,&rsquo; said the Bishop.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; I am afraid it is rather untidy,&rsquo; Swithin
apologized.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And here are your books,&rsquo; the Bishop continued,
turning to the table and the shaded lamp.&nbsp; &lsquo;You take
an observation at the top, I presume, and come down here to
record your observations.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The young man explained his precise processes as well as his
state of mind would let him, and while he was doing so Mr.
Torkingham and Louis waited patiently without, looking sometimes
into the night, and sometimes through the door at the
interlocutors, and listening to their scientific converse.&nbsp;
When all had been exhibited here below, Swithin lit his lantern,
and, inviting his visitors to follow, led the way up the column,
experiencing no small sense of relief as soon as he heard the
footsteps of all three tramping on the stairs behind him.&nbsp;
He knew very well that, once they were inside the spiral,
Viviette was out of danger, her knowledge of the locality
enabling her to find her way with perfect safety through the
plantation, and into the park home.</p>
<p>At the top he uncovered his equatorial, and, for the first
time at ease, explained to them its beauties, and revealed by its
help the glories of those stars that were eligible for
inspection.&nbsp; The Bishop spoke as intelligently as could be
expected on a topic not peculiarly his own; but, somehow, he
seemed rather more abstracted in manner now than when he had
arrived.&nbsp; Swithin thought that perhaps the long clamber up
the stairs, coming after a hard day&rsquo;s work, had taken his
spontaneity out of him, and Mr. Torkingham was afraid that his
lordship was getting bored.&nbsp; But this did not appear to be
the case; for though he said little he stayed on some time
longer, examining the construction of the dome after
relinquishing the telescope; while occasionally Swithin caught
the eyes of the Bishop fixed hard on him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps he sees some likeness of my father in
me,&rsquo; the young man thought; and the party making ready to
leave at this time he conducted them to the bottom of the
tower.</p>
<p>Swithin was not prepared for what followed their
descent.&nbsp; All were standing at the foot of the
staircase.&nbsp; The astronomer, lantern in hand, offered to show
them the way out of the plantation, to which Mr. Torkingham
replied that he knew the way very well, and would not trouble his
young friend.&nbsp; He strode forward with the words, and Louis
followed him, after waiting a moment and finding that the Bishop
would not take the precedence.&nbsp; The latter and Swithin were
thus left together for one moment, whereupon the Bishop
turned.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. St. Cleeve,&rsquo; he said in a strange voice,
&lsquo;I should like to speak to you privately, before I leave,
to-morrow morning.&nbsp; Can you meet me&mdash;let me
see&mdash;in the churchyard, at half-past ten
o&rsquo;clock?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes, my lord, certainly,&rsquo; said Swithin.&nbsp;
And before he had recovered from his surprise the Bishop had
joined the others in the shades of the plantation.</p>
<p>Swithin immediately opened the door of the hut, and scanned
the nook behind the bed.&nbsp; As he had expected his bird had
flown.</p>
<h3>XXVII</h3>
<p>All night the astronomer&rsquo;s mind was on the stretch with
curiosity as to what the Bishop could wish to say to him.&nbsp; A
dozen conjectures entered his brain, to be abandoned in turn as
unlikely.&nbsp; That which finally seemed the most plausible was
that the Bishop, having become interested in his pursuits, and
entertaining friendly recollections of his father, was going to
ask if he could do anything to help him on in the profession he
had chosen.&nbsp; Should this be the case, thought the suddenly
sanguine youth, it would seem like an encouragement to that
spirit of firmness which had led him to reject his late
uncle&rsquo;s offer because it involved the renunciation of Lady
Constantine.</p>
<p>At last he fell asleep; and when he awoke it was so late that
the hour was ready to solve what conjecture could not.&nbsp;
After a hurried breakfast he paced across the fields, entering
the churchyard by the south gate precisely at the appointed
minute.</p>
<p>The inclosure was well adapted for a private interview, being
bounded by bushes of laurel and alder nearly on all sides.&nbsp;
He looked round; the Bishop was not there, nor any living
creature save himself.&nbsp; Swithin sat down upon a tombstone to
await Bishop Helmsdale&rsquo;s arrival.</p>
<p>While he sat he fancied he could hear voices in conversation
not far off, and further attention convinced him that they came
from Lady Constantine&rsquo;s lawn, which was divided from the
churchyard by a high wall and shrubbery only.&nbsp; As the Bishop
still delayed his coming, though the time was nearly eleven, and
as the lady whose sweet voice mingled with those heard from the
lawn was his personal property, Swithin became exceedingly
curious to learn what was going on within that screened
promenade.&nbsp; A way of doing so occurred to him.&nbsp; The key
was in the church door; he opened it, entered, and ascended to
the ringers&rsquo; loft in the west tower.&nbsp; At the back of
this was a window commanding a full view of Viviette&rsquo;s
garden front.</p>
<p>The flowers were all in gayest bloom, and the creepers on the
walls of the house were bursting into tufts of young green.&nbsp;
A broad gravel-walk ran from end to end of the facade,
terminating in a large conservatory.&nbsp; In the walk were three
people pacing up and down.&nbsp; Lady Constantine&rsquo;s was the
central figure, her brother being on one side of her, and on the
other a stately form in a corded shovel-hat of glossy beaver and
black breeches.&nbsp; This was the Bishop.&nbsp; Viviette carried
over her shoulder a sunshade lined with red, which she twirled
idly.&nbsp; They were laughing and chatting gaily, and when the
group approached the churchyard many of their remarks entered the
silence of the church tower through the ventilator of the
window.</p>
<p>The conversation was general, yet interesting enough to
Swithin.&nbsp; At length Louis stepped upon the grass and picked
up something that had lain there, which turned out to be a bowl:
throwing it forward he took a second, and bowled it towards the
first, or jack.&nbsp; The Bishop, who seemed to be in a sprightly
mood, followed suit, and bowled one in a curve towards the jack,
turning and speaking to Lady Constantine as he concluded the
feat.&nbsp; As she had not left the gravelled terrace he raised
his voice, so that the words reached Swithin distinctly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you follow us?&rsquo; he asked gaily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not skilful,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
always bowl narrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Bishop meditatively paused.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This moment reminds one of the scene in <i>Richard the
Second</i>,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I mean the Duke of
York&rsquo;s garden, where the queen and her two ladies play, and
the queen says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;What sport shall we devise here in this
garden,<br />
To drive away the heavy thought of care?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To which her lady answers, &ldquo;Madam, we&rsquo;ll play at
bowls.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s an unfortunate quotation for you,&rsquo;
said Lady Constantine; &lsquo;for if I don&rsquo;t forget, the
queen declines, saying, &ldquo;Twill make me think the world is
full of rubs, and that my fortune runs against the
bias.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then I cite <i>mal &agrave; propos</i>.&nbsp; But it is
an interesting old game, and might have been played at that very
date on this very green.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Bishop lazily bowled another, and while he was doing it
Viviette&rsquo;s glance rose by accident to the church tower
window, where she recognized Swithin&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; Her
surprise was only momentary; and waiting till both her
companions&rsquo; backs were turned she smiled and blew him a
kiss.&nbsp; In another minute she had another opportunity, and
blew him another; afterwards blowing him one a third time.</p>
<p>Her blowings were put a stop to by the Bishop and Louis
throwing down the bowls and rejoining her in the path, the house
clock at the moment striking half-past eleven.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is a fine way of keeping an engagement,&rsquo;
said Swithin to himself.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have waited an hour while
you indulge in those trifles!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He fumed, turned, and behold somebody was at his elbow:
Tabitha Lark.&nbsp; Swithin started, and said, &lsquo;How did you
come here, Tabitha?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the course of my calling, Mr. St. Cleeve,&rsquo;
said the smiling girl.&nbsp; &lsquo;I come to practise on the
organ.&nbsp; When I entered I saw you up here through the tower
arch, and I crept up to see what you were looking at.&nbsp; The
Bishop is a striking man, is he not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, rather,&rsquo; said Swithin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think he is much devoted to Lady Constantine, and I
am glad of it.&nbsp; Aren&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes&mdash;very,&rsquo; said Swithin, wondering if
Tabitha had seen the tender little salutes between Lady
Constantine and himself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think she cares much for him,&rsquo;
added Tabitha judicially.&nbsp; &lsquo;Or, even if she does, she
could be got away from him in no time by a younger
man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pooh, that&rsquo;s nothing,&rsquo; said Swithin
impatiently.</p>
<p>Tabitha then remarked that her blower had not come to time,
and that she must go to look for him; upon which she descended
the stairs, and left Swithin again alone.</p>
<p>A few minutes later the Bishop suddenly looked at his watch,
Lady Constantine having withdrawn towards the house.&nbsp;
Apparently apologizing to Louis the Bishop came down the terrace,
and through the door into the churchyard.&nbsp; Swithin hastened
downstairs and joined him in the path under the sunny wall of the
aisle.</p>
<p>Their glances met, and it was with some consternation that
Swithin beheld the change that a few short minutes had wrought in
that episcopal countenance.&nbsp; On the lawn with Lady
Constantine the rays of an almost perpetual smile had brightened
his dark aspect like flowers in a shady place: now the smile was
gone as completely as yesterday; the lines of his face were firm;
his dark eyes and whiskers were overspread with gravity; and, as
he gazed upon Swithin from the repose of his stable figure it was
like an evangelized King of Spades come to have it out with the
Knave of Hearts.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>To return for a moment to Louis Glanville.&nbsp; He had been
somewhat struck with the abruptness of the Bishop&rsquo;s
departure, and more particularly by the circumstance that he had
gone away by the private door into the churchyard instead of by
the regular exit on the other side.&nbsp; True, great men were
known to suffer from absence of mind, and Bishop Helmsdale,
having a dim sense that he had entered by that door yesterday,
might have unconsciously turned thitherward now.&nbsp; Louis,
upon the whole, thought little of the matter, and being now left
quite alone on the lawn, he seated himself in an arbour and began
smoking.</p>
<p>The arbour was situated against the churchyard wall.&nbsp; The
atmosphere was as still as the air of a hot-house; only fourteen
inches of brickwork divided Louis from the scene of the
Bishop&rsquo;s interview with St. Cleeve, and as voices on the
lawn had been audible to Swithin in the churchyard, voices in the
churchyard could be heard without difficulty from that close
corner of the lawn.&nbsp; No sooner had Louis lit a cigar than
the dialogue began.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, you are here, St. Cleeve,&rsquo; said the Bishop,
hardly replying to Swithin&rsquo;s good morning.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
fear I am a little late.&nbsp; Well, my request to you to meet me
may have seemed somewhat unusual, seeing that we were strangers
till a few hours ago.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mind that, if your lordship wishes to see
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought it best to see you regarding your
confirmation yesterday; and my reason for taking a more active
step with you than I should otherwise have done is that I have
some interest in you through having known your father when we
were undergraduates.&nbsp; His rooms were on the same staircase
with mine at All Angels, and we were friendly till time and
affairs separated us even more completely than usually
happens.&nbsp; However, about your presenting yourself for
confirmation.&rsquo;&nbsp; (The Bishop&rsquo;s voice grew
stern.)&nbsp; &lsquo;If I had known yesterday morning what I knew
twelve hours later, I wouldn&rsquo;t have confirmed you at
all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed, my lord!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I say it, and I mean it.&nbsp; I visited your
observatory last night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You did, my lord.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In inspecting it I noticed something which I may truly
describe as extraordinary.&nbsp; I have had young men present
themselves to me who turned out to be notoriously unfit, either
from giddiness, from being profane or intemperate, or from some
bad quality or other.&nbsp; But I never remember a case which
equalled the cool culpability of this.&nbsp; While infringing the
first principles of social decorum you might at least have
respected the ordinance sufficiently to have stayed away from it
altogether.&nbsp; Now I have sent for you here to see if a last
entreaty and a direct appeal to your sense of manly uprightness
will have any effect in inducing you to change your course of
life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The voice of Swithin in his next remark showed how
tremendously this attack of the Bishop had told upon his
feelings.&nbsp; Louis, of course, did not know the reason why the
words should have affected him precisely as they did; to any one
in the secret the double embarrassment arising from
misapprehended ethics and inability to set matters right, because
his word of secrecy to another was inviolable, would have
accounted for the young man&rsquo;s emotion sufficiently
well.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am very sorry your lordship should have seen anything
objectionable,&rsquo; said Swithin.&nbsp; &lsquo;May I ask what
it was?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know what it was.&nbsp; Something in your chamber,
which forced me to the above conclusions.&nbsp; I disguised my
feelings of sorrow at the time for obvious reasons, but I never
in my whole life was so shocked!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;At what, my lord?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;At what I saw.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pardon me, Bishop Helmsdale, but you said just now that
we are strangers; so what you saw in my cabin concerns me
only.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There I contradict you.&nbsp; Twenty-four hours ago
that remark would have been plausible enough; but by presenting
yourself for confirmation at my hands you have invited my
investigation into your principles.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Swithin sighed.&nbsp; &lsquo;I admit it,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what do I find them?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You say reprehensible.&nbsp; But you might at least let
me hear the proof!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can do more, sir.&nbsp; I can let you see
it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was a pause.&nbsp; Louis Glanville was so highly
interested that he stood upon the seat of the arbour, and looked
through the leafage over the wall.&nbsp; The Bishop had produced
an article from his pocket.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; said Swithin, laboriously
scrutinizing the thing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you see?&rsquo; said the Bishop,
holding it out between his finger and thumb in Swithin&rsquo;s
face.&nbsp; &lsquo;A bracelet,&mdash;a coral bracelet.&nbsp; I
found the wanton object on the bed in your cabin!&nbsp; And of
the sex of the owner there can be no doubt.&nbsp; More than that,
she was concealed behind the curtains, for I saw them
move.&rsquo;&nbsp; In the decision of his opinion the Bishop
threw the coral bracelet down on a tombstone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nobody was in my room, my lord, who had not a perfect
right to be there,&rsquo; said the younger man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, well, that&rsquo;s a matter of assertion.&nbsp;
Now don&rsquo;t get into a passion, and say to me in your haste
what you&rsquo;ll repent of saying afterwards.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not in a passion, I assure your lordship.&nbsp; I
am too sad for passion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well; that&rsquo;s a hopeful sign.&nbsp; Now I
would ask you, as one man of another, do you think that to come
to me, the Bishop of this large and important diocese, as you
came yesterday, and pretend to be something that you are not, is
quite upright conduct, leave alone religious?&nbsp; Think it
over.&nbsp; We may never meet again.&nbsp; But bear in mind what
your Bishop and spiritual head says to you, and see if you cannot
mend before it is too late.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Swithin was meek as Moses, but he tried to appear
sturdy.&nbsp; &lsquo;My lord, I am in a difficult
position,&rsquo; he said mournfully; &lsquo;how difficult, nobody
but myself can tell.&nbsp; I cannot explain; there are
insuperable reasons against it.&nbsp; But will you take my word
of assurance that I am not so bad as I seem?&nbsp; Some day I
will prove it.&nbsp; Till then I only ask you to suspend your
judgment on me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Bishop shook his head incredulously and went towards the
vicarage, as if he had lost his hearing.&nbsp; Swithin followed
him with his eyes, and Louis followed the direction of
Swithin&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Before the Bishop had reached the vicarage
entrance Lady Constantine crossed in front of him.&nbsp; She had
a basket on her arm, and was, in fact, going to visit some of the
poorer cottages.&nbsp; Who could believe the Bishop now to be the
same man that he had been a moment before?&nbsp; The darkness
left his face as if he had come out of a cave; his look was all
sweetness, and shine, and gaiety, as he again greeted
Viviette.</p>
<h3>XXVIII</h3>
<p>The conversation which arose between the Bishop and Lady
Constantine was of that lively and reproductive kind which cannot
be ended during any reasonable halt of two people going in
opposite directions.&nbsp; He turned, and walked with her along
the laurel-screened lane that bordered the churchyard, till their
voices died away in the distance.&nbsp; Swithin then aroused
himself from his thoughtful regard of them, and went out of the
churchyard by another gate.</p>
<p>Seeing himself now to be left alone on the scene, Louis
Glanville descended from his post of observation in the
arbour.&nbsp; He came through the private doorway, and on to that
spot among the graves where the Bishop and St. Cleeve had
conversed.&nbsp; On the tombstone still lay the coral bracelet
which Dr. Helmsdale had flung down there in his indignation; for
the agitated, introspective mood into which Swithin had been
thrown had banished from his mind all thought of securing the
trinket and putting it in his pocket.</p>
<p>Louis picked up the little red scandal-breeding thing, and
while walking on with it in his hand he observed Tabitha Lark
approaching the church, in company with the young blower whom she
had gone in search of to inspire her organ-practising
within.&nbsp; Louis immediately put together, with that rare
diplomatic keenness of which he was proud, the little scene he
had witnessed between Tabitha and Swithin during the
confirmation, and the Bishop&rsquo;s stern statement as to where
he had found the bracelet.&nbsp; He had no longer any doubt that
it belonged to her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor girl!&rsquo; he said to himself, and sang in an
undertone&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Tra deri, dera,<br />
L&rsquo;histoire n&rsquo;est pas nouvelle!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When she drew nearer Louis called her by name.&nbsp; She sent
the boy into the church, and came forward, blushing at having
been called by so fine a gentleman.&nbsp; Louis held out the
bracelet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here is something I have found, or somebody else has
found,&rsquo; he said to her.&nbsp; &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t state
where.&nbsp; Put it away, and say no more about it.&nbsp; I will
not mention it either.&nbsp; Now go on into the church where you
are going, and may Heaven have mercy on your soul, my
dear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, sir,&rsquo; said Tabitha, with some
perplexity, yet inclined to be pleased, and only recognizing in
the situation the fact that Lady Constantine&rsquo;s humorous
brother was making her a present.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are much obliged to me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Miss Lark, I&rsquo;ve discovered a secret, you
see.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What may that be, Mr. Glanville?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That you are in love.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t admit it, sir.&nbsp; Who told you
so?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nobody.&nbsp; Only I put two and two together.&nbsp;
Now take my advice.&nbsp; Beware of lovers!&nbsp; They are a bad
lot, and bring young women to tears.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some do, I dare say.&nbsp; But some
don&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you think that in your particular case the latter
alternative will hold good?&nbsp; We generally think we shall be
lucky ourselves, though all the world before us, in the same
situation, have been otherwise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes, or we should die outright of despair.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t think you will be lucky in your
case.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Please how do you know so much, since my case has not
yet arrived?&rsquo; asked Tabitha, tossing her head a little
disdainfully, but less than she might have done if he had not
obtained a charter for his discourse by giving her the
bracelet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fie, Tabitha!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I tell you it has not arrived!&rsquo; she said, with
some anger.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have not got a lover, and everybody
knows I haven&rsquo;t, and it&rsquo;s an insinuating thing for
you to say so!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Louis laughed, thinking how natural it was that a girl should
so emphatically deny circumstances that would not bear curious
inquiry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, of course I meant myself,&rsquo; he said
soothingly.&nbsp; &lsquo;So, then, you will not accept
me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you meant yourself,&rsquo; she
replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;But I won&rsquo;t accept you.&nbsp; And I
think you ought not to jest on such subjects.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, perhaps not.&nbsp; However, don&rsquo;t let the
Bishop see your bracelet, and all will be well.&nbsp; But mind,
lovers are deceivers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Tabitha laughed, and they parted, the girl entering the
church.&nbsp; She had been feeling almost certain that, having
accidentally found the bracelet somewhere, he had presented it in
a whim to her as the first girl he met.&nbsp; Yet now she began
to have momentary doubts whether he had not been labouring under
a mistake, and had imagined her to be the owner.&nbsp; The
bracelet was not valuable; it was, in fact, a mere toy,&mdash;the
pair of which this was one being a little present made to Lady
Constantine by Swithin on the day of their marriage; and she had
not worn them with sufficient frequency out of doors for Tabitha
to recognize either as positively her ladyship&rsquo;s.&nbsp; But
when, out of sight of the blower, the girl momentarily tried it
on, in a corner by the organ, it seemed to her that the ornament
was possibly Lady Constantine&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Now that the pink
beads shone before her eyes on her own arm she remembered having
seen a bracelet with just such an effect gracing the wrist of
Lady Constantine upon one occasion.&nbsp; A temporary
self-surrender to the sophism that if Mr. Louis Glanville chose
to give away anything belonging to his sister, she, Tabitha, had
a right to take it without question, was soon checked by a
resolve to carry the tempting strings of coral to her ladyship
that evening, and inquire the truth about them.&nbsp; This
decided on she slipped the bracelet into her pocket, and played
her voluntaries with a light heart.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Bishop Helmsdale did not tear himself away from Welland till
about two o&rsquo;clock that afternoon, which was three hours
later than he had intended to leave.&nbsp; It was with a feeling
of relief that Swithin, looking from the top of the tower, saw
the carriage drive out from the vicarage into the turnpike road,
and whirl the right reverend gentleman again towards
Warborne.&nbsp; The coast being now clear of him Swithin
meditated how to see Viviette, and explain what had
happened.&nbsp; With this in view he waited where he was till
evening came on.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Lady Constantine and her brother dined by themselves
at Welland House.&nbsp; They had not met since the morning, and
as soon as they were left alone Louis said, &lsquo;You have done
very well so far; but you might have been a little
warmer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Done well?&rsquo; she asked, with surprise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, with the Bishop.&nbsp; The difficult question is
how to follow up our advantage.&nbsp; How are you to keep
yourself in sight of him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Heavens, Louis! You don&rsquo;t seriously mean that the
Bishop of Melchester has any feelings for me other than
friendly?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Viviette, this is affectation.&nbsp; You know he has as
well as I do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She sighed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
own I had a suspicion of the same thing.&nbsp; What a
misfortune!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A misfortune?&nbsp; Surely the world is turned upside
down!&nbsp; You will drive me to despair about our future if you
see things so awry.&nbsp; Exert yourself to do something, so as
to make of this accident a stepping-stone to higher things.&nbsp;
The gentleman will give us the slip if we don&rsquo;t pursue the
friendship at once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot have you talk like this,&rsquo; she cried
impatiently.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have no more thought of the Bishop
than I have of the Pope.&nbsp; I would much rather not have had
him here to lunch at all.&nbsp; You said it would be necessary to
do it, and an opportunity, and I thought it my duty to show some
hospitality when he was coming so near, Mr. Torkingham&rsquo;s
house being so small.&nbsp; But of course I understood that the
opportunity would be one for you in getting to know him, your
prospects being so indefinite at present; not one for
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you don&rsquo;t follow up this chance of being
spiritual queen of Melchester, you will never have another of
being anything.&nbsp; Mind this, Viviette: you are not so young
as you were.&nbsp; You are getting on to be a middle-aged woman,
and your black hair is precisely of the sort which time quickly
turns grey.&nbsp; You must make up your mind to grizzled
bachelors or widowers.&nbsp; Young marriageable men won&rsquo;t
look at you; or if they do just now, in a year or two more
they&rsquo;ll despise you as an antiquated party.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lady Constantine perceptibly paled.&nbsp; &lsquo;Young men
what?&rsquo; she asked.&nbsp; &lsquo;Say that again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I said it was no use to think of young men; they
won&rsquo;t look at you much longer; or if they do, it will be to
look away again very quickly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You imply that if I were to marry a man younger than
myself he would speedily acquire a contempt for me?&nbsp; How
much younger must a man be than his wife&mdash;to get that
feeling for her?&rsquo;&nbsp; She was resting her elbow on the
chair as she faintly spoke the words, and covered her eyes with
her hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;An exceedingly small number of years,&rsquo; said Louis
drily.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now the Bishop is at least fifteen years
older than you, and on that account, no less than on others, is
an excellent match.&nbsp; You would be head of the church in this
diocese: what more can you require after these years of miserable
obscurity?&nbsp; In addition, you would escape that minor thorn
in the flesh of bishops&rsquo; wives, of being only
&ldquo;Mrs.&rdquo; while their husbands are peers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She was not listening; his previous observation still detained
her thoughts.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Louis,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;in the case of a woman
marrying a man much younger than herself, does he get to dislike
her, even if there has been a social advantage to him in the
union?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&mdash;not a whit less.&nbsp; Ask any person of
experience.&nbsp; But what of that?&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s talk of our
own affairs.&nbsp; You say you have no thought of the
Bishop.&nbsp; And yet if he had stayed here another day or two he
would have proposed to you straight off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Seriously, Louis, I could not accept him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t love him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, oh, I like those words!&rsquo; cried Louis,
throwing himself back in his chair and looking at the ceiling in
satirical enjoyment.&nbsp; &lsquo;A woman who at two-and-twenty
married for convenience, at thirty talks of not marrying without
love; the rule of inverse, that is, in which more requires less,
and less requires more.&nbsp; As your only brother, older than
yourself, and more experienced, I insist that you encourage the
Bishop.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t quarrel with me, Louis!&rsquo; she said
piteously.&nbsp; &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t know that he thinks
anything of me,&mdash;we only guess.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know it,&mdash;and you shall hear how I know.&nbsp; I
am of a curious and conjectural nature, as you are aware.&nbsp;
Last night, when everybody had gone to bed, I stepped out for a
five minutes&rsquo; smoke on the lawn, and walked down to where
you get near the vicarage windows.&nbsp; While I was there in the
dark one of them opened, and Bishop Helmsdale leant out.&nbsp;
The illuminated oblong of your window shone him full in the face
between the trees, and presently your shadow crossed it.&nbsp; He
waved his hand, and murmured some tender words, though what they
were exactly I could not hear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a vague, imaginary story,&mdash;as if he could
know my shadow!&nbsp; Besides, a man of the Bishop&rsquo;s
dignity wouldn&rsquo;t have done such a thing.&nbsp; When I knew
him as a younger man he was not at all romantic, and he&rsquo;s
not likely to have grown so now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s just what he is likely to have done.&nbsp;
No lover is so extreme a specimen of the species as an old
lover.&nbsp; Come, Viviette, no more of this fencing.&nbsp; I
have entered into the project heart and soul&mdash;so much that I
have postponed my departure till the matter is well under
way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Louis&mdash;my dear Louis&mdash;you will bring me into
some disagreeable position!&rsquo; said she, clasping her
hands.&nbsp; &lsquo;I do entreat you not to interfere or do
anything rash about me.&nbsp; The step is impossible.&nbsp; I
have something to tell you some day.&nbsp; I must live on, and
endure&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Everything except this penury,&rsquo; replied Louis,
unmoved.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come, I have begun the campaign by inviting
Bishop Helmsdale, and I&rsquo;ll take the responsibility of
carrying it on.&nbsp; All I ask of you is not to make a ninny of
yourself.&nbsp; Come, give me your promise!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I cannot,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know how to!&nbsp; I
only know one thing,&mdash;that I am in no
hurry&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;No hurry&rdquo; be hanged!&nbsp; Agree, like a
good sister, to charm the Bishop.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must consider!&rsquo; she replied, with perturbed
evasiveness.</p>
<p>It being a fine evening Louis went out of the house to enjoy
his cigar in the shrubbery.&nbsp; On reaching his favourite seat
he found he had left his cigar-case behind him; he immediately
returned for it.&nbsp; When he approached the window by which he
had emerged he saw Swithin St. Cleeve standing there in the dusk,
talking to Viviette inside.</p>
<p>St. Cleeve&rsquo;s back was towards Louis, but, whether at a
signal from her or by accident, he quickly turned and recognized
Glanville; whereupon raising his hat to Lady Constantine the
young man passed along the terrace-walk and out by the churchyard
door.</p>
<p>Louis rejoined his sister.&nbsp; &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t know
you allowed your lawn to be a public thoroughfare for the
parish,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not exclusive, especially since I have been so
poor,&rsquo; replied she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then do you let everybody pass this way, or only that
illustrious youth because he is so good-looking?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have no strict rule in the case.&nbsp; Mr. St. Cleeve
is an acquaintance of mine, and he can certainly come here if he
chooses.&rsquo;&nbsp; Her colour rose somewhat, and she spoke
warmly.</p>
<p>Louis was too cautious a bird to reveal to her what had
suddenly dawned upon his mind&mdash;that his sister, in common
with the (to his thinking) unhappy Tabitha Lark, had been foolish
enough to get interested in this phenomenon of the parish, this
scientific Adonis.&nbsp; But he resolved to cure at once her
tender feeling, if it existed, by letting out a secret which
would inflame her dignity against the weakness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A good-looking young man,&rsquo; he said, with his eyes
where Swithin had vanished.&nbsp; &lsquo;But not so good as he
looks.&nbsp; In fact a regular young sinner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, only a little feature I discovered in St.
Cleeve&rsquo;s history.&nbsp; But I suppose he has a right to sow
his wild oats as well as other young men.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell me what you allude to,&mdash;do, Louis.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is hardly fit that I should.&nbsp; However, the case
is amusing enough.&nbsp; I was sitting in the arbour to-day, and
was an unwilling listener to the oddest interview I ever heard
of.&nbsp; Our friend the Bishop discovered, when we visited the
observatory last night, that our astronomer was not alone in his
seclusion.&nbsp; A lady shared his romantic cabin with him; and
finding this, the Bishop naturally enough felt that the ordinance
of confirmation had been profaned.&nbsp; So his lordship sent for
Master Swithin this morning, and meeting him in the churchyard
read him such an excommunicating lecture as I warrant he
won&rsquo;t forget in his lifetime.&nbsp; Ha-ha-ha!&nbsp;
&rsquo;Twas very good,&mdash;very.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He watched her face narrowly while he spoke with such seeming
carelessness.&nbsp; Instead of the agitation of jealousy that he
had expected to be aroused by this hint of another woman in the
case, there was a curious expression, more like embarrassment
than anything else which might have been fairly attributed to the
subject.&nbsp; &lsquo;Can it be that I am mistaken?&rsquo; he
asked himself.</p>
<p>The possibility that he might be mistaken restored Louis to
good-humour, and lights having been brought he sat with his
sister for some time, talking with purpose of Swithin&rsquo;s low
rank on one side, and the sordid struggles that might be in store
for him.&nbsp; St. Cleeve being in the unhappy case of deriving
his existence through two channels of society, it resulted that
he seemed to belong to either this or that according to the
altitude of the beholder.&nbsp; Louis threw the light entirely on
Swithin&rsquo;s agricultural side, bringing out old Mrs. Martin
and her connexions and her ways of life with luminous
distinctness, till Lady Constantine became greatly
depressed.&nbsp; She, in her hopefulness, had almost forgotten,
latterly, that the bucolic element, so incisively represented by
Messrs. Hezzy Biles, Haymoss Fry, Sammy Blore, and the rest
entered into his condition at all; to her he had been the son of
his academic father alone.</p>
<p>But she would not reveal the depression to which she had been
subjected by this resuscitation of the homely half of poor
Swithin, presently putting an end to the subject by walking
hither and thither about the room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What have you lost?&rsquo; said Louis, observing her
movements.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing of consequence,&mdash;a bracelet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Coral?&rsquo; he inquired calmly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; How did you know it was coral?&nbsp; You
have never seen it, have you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was about to make answer; but the amazed enlightenment
which her announcement had produced in him through knowing where
the Bishop had found such an article, led him to reconsider
himself.&nbsp; Then, like an astute man, by no means sure of the
dimensions of the intrigue he might be uncovering, he said
carelessly, &lsquo;I found such a one in the churchyard
to-day.&nbsp; But I thought it appeared to be of no great rarity,
and I gave it to one of the village girls who was passing
by.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did she take it?&nbsp; Who was she?&rsquo; said the
unsuspecting Viviette.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Really, I don&rsquo;t remember.&nbsp; I suppose it is
of no consequence?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O no; its value is nothing, comparatively.&nbsp; It was
only one of a pair such as young girls wear.&rsquo;&nbsp; Lady
Constantine could not add that, in spite of this, she herself
valued it as being Swithin&rsquo;s present, and the best he could
afford.</p>
<p>Panic-struck by his ruminations, although revealing nothing by
his manner, Louis soon after went up to his room, professedly to
write letters.&nbsp; He gave vent to a low whistle when he was
out of hearing.&nbsp; He of course remembered perfectly well to
whom he had given the corals, and resolved to seek out Tabitha
the next morning to ascertain whether she could possibly have
owned such a trinket as well as his sister,&mdash;which at
present he very greatly doubted, though fervently hoping that she
might.</p>
<h3>XXIX</h3>
<p>The effect upon Swithin of the interview with the Bishop had
been a very marked one.&nbsp; He felt that he had good ground for
resenting that dignitary&rsquo;s tone in haughtily assuming that
all must be sinful which at the first blush appeared to be so,
and in narrowly refusing a young man the benefit of a single
doubt.&nbsp; Swithin&rsquo;s assurance that he would be able to
explain all some day had been taken in contemptuous
incredulity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He may be as virtuous as his prototype Timothy; but
he&rsquo;s an opinionated old fogey all the same,&rsquo; said St.
Cleeve petulantly.</p>
<p>Yet, on the other hand, Swithin&rsquo;s nature was so fresh
and ingenuous, notwithstanding that recent affairs had somewhat
denaturalized him, that for a man in the Bishop&rsquo;s position
to think him immoral was almost as overwhelming as if he had
actually been so, and at moments he could scarcely bear existence
under so gross a suspicion.&nbsp; What was his union with Lady
Constantine worth to him when, by reason of it, he was thought a
reprobate by almost the only man who had professed to take an
interest in him?</p>
<p>Certainly, by contrast with his air-built image of himself as
a worthy astronomer, received by all the world, and the envied
husband of Viviette, the present imputation was
humiliating.&nbsp; The glorious light of this tender and refined
passion seemed to have become debased to burlesque hues by pure
accident, and his &aelig;sthetic no less than his ethic taste was
offended by such an anti-climax.&nbsp; He who had soared amid the
remotest grandeurs of nature had been taken to task on a
rudimentary question of morals, which had never been a question
with him at all.&nbsp; This was what the exigencies of an awkward
attachment had brought him to; but he blamed the circumstances,
and not for one moment Lady Constantine.</p>
<p>Having now set his heart against a longer concealment he was
disposed to think that an excellent way of beginning a revelation
of their marriage would be by writing a confidential letter to
the Bishop, detailing the whole case.&nbsp; But it was impossible
to do this on his own responsibility.&nbsp; He still recognized
the understanding entered into with Viviette, before the
marriage, to be as binding as ever,&mdash;that the initiative in
disclosing their union should come from her.&nbsp; Yet he hardly
doubted that she would take that initiative when he told her of
his extraordinary reprimand in the churchyard.</p>
<p>This was what he had come to do when Louis saw him standing at
the window.&nbsp; But before he had said half-a-dozen words to
Viviette she motioned him to go on, which he mechanically did,
ere he could sufficiently collect his thoughts on its
advisability or otherwise.&nbsp; He did not, however, go
far.&nbsp; While Louis and his sister were discussing him in the
drawing-room he lingered musing in the churchyard, hoping that
she might be able to escape and join him in the consultation he
so earnestly desired.</p>
<p>She at last found opportunity to do this.&nbsp; As soon as
Louis had left the room and shut himself in upstairs she ran out
by the window in the direction Swithin had taken.&nbsp; When her
footsteps began crunching on the gravel he came forward from the
churchyard door.</p>
<p>They embraced each other in haste, and then, in a few short
panting words, she explained to him that her brother had heard
and witnessed the interview on that spot between himself and the
Bishop, and had told her the substance of the Bishop&rsquo;s
accusation, not knowing she was the woman in the cabin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what I cannot understand is this,&rsquo; she added;
&lsquo;how did the Bishop discover that the person behind the
bed-curtains was a woman and not a man?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Swithin explained that the Bishop had found the bracelet on
the bed, and had brought it to him in the churchyard.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Swithin, what do you say?&nbsp; Found the coral
bracelet?&nbsp; What did you do with it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Swithin clapped his hand to his pocket.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear me!&nbsp; I recollect&mdash;I left it where it lay
on Reuben Heath&rsquo;s tombstone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, my dear, dear Swithin!&rsquo; she cried
miserably.&nbsp; &lsquo;You have compromised me by your
forgetfulness.&nbsp; I have claimed the article as mine.&nbsp; My
brother did not tell me that the Bishop brought it from the
cabin.&nbsp; What can I, can I do, that neither the Bishop nor my
brother may conclude <i>I</i> was the woman there?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But if we announce our marriage&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Even as your wife, the position was too
undignified&mdash;too I don&rsquo;t know what&mdash;for me ever
to admit that I was there!&nbsp; Right or wrong, I must declare
the bracelet was not mine.&nbsp; Such an escapade&mdash;why, it
would make me ridiculous in the county; and anything rather than
that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was in hope that you would agree to let our marriage
be known,&rsquo; said Swithin, with some disappointment.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I thought that these circumstances would make the reason
for doing so doubly strong.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; But there are, alas, reasons against it
still stronger!&nbsp; Let me have my way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly, dearest.&nbsp; I promised that before you
agreed to be mine.&nbsp; My reputation&mdash;what is it!&nbsp;
Perhaps I shall be dead and forgotten before the next transit of
Venus!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She soothed him tenderly, but could not tell him why she felt
the reasons against any announcement as yet to be stronger than
those in favour of it.&nbsp; How could she, when her feeling had
been cautiously fed and developed by her brother Louis&rsquo;s
unvarnished exhibition of Swithin&rsquo;s material position in
the eyes of the world?&mdash;that of a young man, the scion of a
family of farmers recently her tenants, living at the homestead
with his grandmother, Mrs. Martin.</p>
<p>To soften her refusal she said in declaring it, &lsquo;One
concession, Swithin, I certainly will make.&nbsp; I will see you
oftener.&nbsp; I will come to the cabin and tower frequently; and
will contrive, too, that you come to the house
occasionally.&nbsp; During the last winter we passed whole weeks
without meeting; don&rsquo;t let us allow that to happen
again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very well, dearest,&rsquo; said Swithin
good-humouredly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care so terribly much
for the old man&rsquo;s opinion of me, after all.&nbsp; For the
present, then, let things be as they are.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the youth felt her refusal more than he owned;
but the unequal temperament of Swithin&rsquo;s age, so soon
depressed on his own account, was also soon to recover on hers,
and it was with almost a child&rsquo;s forgetfulness of the past
that he took her view of the case.</p>
<p>When he was gone she hastily re-entered the house.&nbsp; Her
brother had not reappeared from upstairs; but she was informed
that Tabitha Lark was waiting to see her, if her ladyship would
pardon the said Tabitha for coming so late.&nbsp; Lady
Constantine made no objection, and saw the young girl at
once.</p>
<p>When Lady Constantine entered the waiting-room behold, in
Tabitha&rsquo;s outstretched hand lay the coral ornament which
had been causing Viviette so much anxiety.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I guessed, on second thoughts, that it was yours, my
lady,&rsquo; said Tabitha, with rather a frightened face;
&lsquo;and so I have brought it back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But how did you come by it, Tabitha?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Glanville gave it to me; he must have thought it
was mine.&nbsp; I took it, fancying at the moment that he handed
it to me because I happened to come by first after he had found
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lady Constantine saw how the situation might be improved so as
to effect her deliverance from this troublesome little web of
evidence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, you can keep it,&rsquo; she said brightly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It was very good of you to bring it back.&nbsp; But keep
it for your very own.&nbsp; Take Mr. Glanville at his word, and
don&rsquo;t explain.&nbsp; And, Tabitha, divide the strands into
two bracelets; there are enough of them to make a
pair.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The next morning, in pursuance of his resolution, Louis
wandered round the grounds till he saw the girl for whom he was
waiting enter the church.&nbsp; He accosted her over the
wall.&nbsp; But, puzzling to view, a coral bracelet blushed on
each of her young arms, for she had promptly carried out the
suggestion of Lady Constantine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are wearing it, I see, Tabitha, with the
other,&rsquo; he murmured.&nbsp; &lsquo;Then you mean to keep
it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I mean to keep it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are sure it is not Lady Constantine&rsquo;s?&nbsp;
I find she has one like it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite sure.&nbsp; But you had better take it to her,
sir, and ask her,&rsquo; said the saucy girl.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, no; that&rsquo;s not necessary,&rsquo; replied
Louis, considerably shaken in his convictions.</p>
<p>When Louis met his sister, a short time after, he did not
catch her, as he had intended to do, by saying suddenly, &lsquo;I
have found your bracelet.&nbsp; I know who has got it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You cannot have found it,&rsquo; she replied quietly,
&lsquo;for I have discovered that it was never lost,&rsquo; and
stretching out both her hands she revealed one on each, Viviette
having performed the same operation with her remaining bracelet
that she had advised Tabitha to do with the other.</p>
<p>Louis was mystified, but by no means convinced.&nbsp; In spite
of this attempt to hoodwink him his mind returned to the subject
every hour of the day.&nbsp; There was no doubt that either
Tabitha or Viviette had been with Swithin in the cabin.&nbsp; He
recapitulated every case that had occurred during his visit to
Welland in which his sister&rsquo;s manner had been of a colour
to justify the suspicion that it was she.&nbsp; There was that
strange incident in the corridor, when she had screamed at what
she described to be a shadowy resemblance to her late husband;
how very improbable that this fancy should have been the only
cause of her agitation!&nbsp; Then he had noticed, during
Swithin&rsquo;s confirmation, a blush upon her cheek when he
passed her on his way to the Bishop, and the fervour in her
glance during the few moments of the imposition of hands.&nbsp;
Then he suddenly recalled the night at the railway station, when
the accident with the whip took place, and how, when he reached
Welland House an hour later, he had found no Viviette
there.&nbsp; Running thus from incident to incident he increased
his suspicions without being able to cull from the circumstances
anything amounting to evidence; but evidence he now determined to
acquire without saying a word to any one.</p>
<p>His plan was of a cruel kind: to set a trap into which the
pair would blindly walk if any secret understanding existed
between them of the nature he suspected.</p>
<h3>XXX</h3>
<p>Louis began his stratagem by calling at the tower one
afternoon, as if on the impulse of the moment.</p>
<p>After a friendly chat with Swithin, whom he found there
(having watched him enter), Louis invited the young man to dine
the same evening at the House, that he might have an opportunity
of showing him some interesting old scientific works in folio,
which, according to Louis&rsquo;s account, he had stumbled on in
the library.&nbsp; Louis set no great bait for St. Cleeve in this
statement, for old science was not old art which, having
perfected itself, has died and left its secret hidden in its
remains.&nbsp; But Swithin was a responsive fellow, and readily
agreed to come; being, moreover, always glad of a chance of
meeting Viviette <i>en famille</i>.&nbsp; He hoped to tell her of a
scheme that had lately suggested itself to him as likely to
benefit them both: that he should go away for a while, and
endeavour to raise sufficient funds to visit the great
observatories of Europe, with an eye to a post in one of
them.&nbsp; Hitherto the only bar to the plan had been the
exceeding narrowness of his income, which, though sufficient for
his present life, was absolutely inadequate to the requirements
of a travelling astronomer.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Louis Glanville had returned to the House and told
his sister in the most innocent manner that he had been in the
company of St. Cleeve that afternoon, getting a few wrinkles on
astronomy; that they had grown so friendly over the fascinating
subject as to leave him no alternative but to invite St. Cleeve
to dine at Welland the same evening, with a view to certain
researches in the library afterwards.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I could quite make allowances for any youthful errors
into which he may have been betrayed,&rsquo; Louis continued
sententiously, &lsquo;since, for a scientist, he is really
admirable.&nbsp; No doubt the Bishop&rsquo;s caution will not be
lost upon him; and as for his birth and connexions,&mdash;those
he can&rsquo;t help.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lady Constantine showed such alacrity in adopting the idea of
having Swithin to dinner, and she ignored his &lsquo;youthful
errors&rsquo; so completely, as almost to betray herself.&nbsp;
In fulfilment of her promise to see him oftener she had been
intending to run across to Swithin on that identical
evening.&nbsp; Now the trouble would be saved in a very
delightful way, by the exercise of a little hospitality which
Viviette herself would not have dared to suggest.</p>
<p>Dinner-time came and with it Swithin, exhibiting rather a
blushing and nervous manner that was, unfortunately, more likely
to betray their cause than was Viviette&rsquo;s own more
practised bearing.&nbsp; Throughout the meal Louis sat like a
spider in the corner of his web, observing them narrowly, and at
moments flinging out an artful thread here and there, with a view
to their entanglement.&nbsp; But they underwent the ordeal
marvellously well.&nbsp; Perhaps the actual tie between them,
through being so much closer and of so much more practical a
nature than even their critic supposed it, was in itself a
protection against their exhibiting that ultra-reciprocity of
manner which, if they had been merely lovers, might have betrayed
them.</p>
<p>After dinner the trio duly adjourned to the library as had
been planned, and the volumes were brought forth by Louis with
the zest of a bibliophilist.&nbsp; Swithin had seen most of them
before, and thought but little of them; but the pleasure of
staying in the house made him welcome any reason for doing so,
and he willingly looked at whatever was put before him, from
Bertius&rsquo;s Ptolemy to Rees&rsquo;s Cyclop&aelig;dia.</p>
<p>The evening thus passed away, and it began to grow late.&nbsp;
Swithin who, among other things, had planned to go to Greenwich
next day to view the Royal Observatory, would every now and then
start up and prepare to leave for home, when Glanville would
unearth some other volume and so detain him yet another
half-hour.</p>
<p>&lsquo;By George!&rsquo; he said, looking at the clock when
Swithin was at last really about to depart.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
didn&rsquo;t know it was so late.&nbsp; Why not stay here
to-night, St. Cleeve?&nbsp; It is very dark, and the way to your
place is an awkward cross-cut over the fields.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It would not inconvenience us at all, Mr. St. Cleeve,
if you would care to stay,&rsquo; said Lady Constantine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid&mdash;the fact is, I wanted to take an
observation at twenty minutes past two,&rsquo; began Swithin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, now, never mind your observation,&rsquo; said
Louis.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s only an excuse.&nbsp; Do that
to-morrow night.&nbsp; Now you will stay.&nbsp; It is
settled.&nbsp; Viviette, say he must stay, and we&rsquo;ll have
another hour of these charming intellectual
researches.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Viviette obeyed with delightful ease.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do stay, Mr
St. Cleeve!&rsquo; she said sweetly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, in truth I can do without the observation,&rsquo;
replied the young man, as he gave way.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is not of
the greatest consequence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thus it was arranged; but the researches among the tomes were
not prolonged to the extent that Louis had suggested.&nbsp; In
three-quarters of an hour from that time they had all retired to
their respective rooms; Lady Constantine&rsquo;s being on one
side of the west corridor, Swithin&rsquo;s opposite, and
Louis&rsquo;s at the further end.</p>
<p>Had a person followed Louis when he withdrew, that watcher
would have discovered, on peeping through the key-hole of his
door, that he was engaged in one of the oddest of occupations for
such a man,&mdash;sweeping down from the ceiling, by means of a
walking-cane, a long cobweb which lingered on high in the
corner.&nbsp; Keeping it stretched upon the cane he gently opened
the door, and set the candle in such a position on the mat that
the light shone down the corridor.&nbsp; Thus guided by its rays
he passed out slipperless, till he reached the door of St.
Cleeve&rsquo;s room, where he applied the dangling spider&rsquo;s
thread in such a manner that it stretched across like a
tight-rope from jamb to jamb, barring, in its fragile way,
entrance and egress.&nbsp; The operation completed he retired
again, and, extinguishing his light, went through his bedroom
window out upon the flat roof of the portico to which it gave
access.</p>
<p>Here Louis made himself comfortable in his chair and
smoking-cap, enjoying the fragrance of a cigar for something like
half-an-hour.&nbsp; His position commanded a view of the two
windows of Lady Constantine&rsquo;s room, and from these a dim
light shone continuously.&nbsp; Having the window partly open at
his back, and the door of his room also scarcely closed, his ear
retained a fair command of any noises that might be made.</p>
<p>In due time faint movements became audible; whereupon,
returning to his room, he re-entered the corridor and listened
intently.&nbsp; All was silent again, and darkness reigned from
end to end.&nbsp; Glanville, however, groped his way along the
passage till he again reached Swithin&rsquo;s door, where he
examined, by the light of a wax-match he had brought, the
condition of the spider&rsquo;s thread.&nbsp; It was gone;
somebody had carried it off bodily, as Samson carried off the pin
and the web.&nbsp; In other words, a person had passed through
the door.</p>
<p>Still holding the faint wax-light in his hand Louis turned to
the door of Lady Constantine&rsquo;s chamber, where he observed
first that, though it was pushed together so as to appear
fastened to cursory view, the door was not really closed by about
a quarter of an inch.&nbsp; He dropped his light and extinguished
it with his foot.&nbsp; Listening, he heard a voice
within,&mdash;Viviette&rsquo;s voice, in a subdued murmur, though
speaking earnestly.</p>
<p>Without any hesitation Louis then returned to Swithin&rsquo;s
door, opened it, and walked in.&nbsp; The starlight from without
was sufficient, now that his eyes had become accustomed to the
darkness, to reveal that the room was unoccupied, and that
nothing therein had been disturbed.</p>
<p>With a heavy tread Louis came forth, walked loudly across the
corridor, knocked at Lady Constantine&rsquo;s door, and called
&lsquo;Viviette!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She heard him instantly, replying &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; in
startled tones.&nbsp; Immediately afterwards she opened her door,
and confronted him in her dressing-gown, with a light in her
hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;What is the matter, Louis?&rsquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am greatly alarmed.&nbsp; Our visitor is
missing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Missing?&nbsp; What, Mr. St. Cleeve?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; I was sitting up to finish a cigar, when I
thought I heard a noise in this direction.&nbsp; On coming to his
room I find he is not there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good Heaven!&nbsp; I wonder what has happened!&rsquo;
she exclaimed, in apparently intense alarm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wonder,&rsquo; said Glanville grimly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Suppose he is a somnambulist!&nbsp; If so, he may have
gone out and broken his neck.&nbsp; I have never heard that he is
one, but they say that sleeping in strange places disturbs the
minds of people who are given to that sort of thing, and provokes
them to it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Unfortunately for your theory his bed has not been
touched.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, what then can it be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her brother looked her full in the face.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Viviette!&rsquo; he said sternly.</p>
<p>She seemed puzzled.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well?&rsquo; she replied, in
simple tones.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I heard voices in your room,&rsquo; he continued.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Voices?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A voice,&mdash;yours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, you may have done so.&nbsp; It was
mine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A listener is required for a speaker.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;True, Louis.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, to whom were you speaking?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;God.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Viviette!&nbsp; I am ashamed of you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was saying my prayers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Prayers&mdash;to God!&nbsp; To St. Swithin,
rather!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you mean, Louis?&rsquo; she asked, flushing up
warm, and drawing back from him.&nbsp; &lsquo;It was a form of
prayer I use, particularly when I am in trouble.&nbsp; It was
recommended to me by the Bishop, and Mr. Torkingham commends it
very highly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;On your honour, if you have any,&rsquo; he said
bitterly, &lsquo;whom have you there in your room?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No human being.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Flatly, I don&rsquo;t believe you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She gave a dignified little bow, and, waving her hand into the
apartment, said, &lsquo;Very well; then search and
see.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Louis entered, and glanced round the room, behind the
curtains, under the bed, out of the window&mdash;a view from
which showed that escape thence would have been
impossible,&mdash;everywhere, in short, capable or incapable of
affording a retreat to humanity; but discovered nobody.&nbsp; All
he observed was that a light stood on the low table by her
bedside; that on the bed lay an open Prayer-Book, the counterpane
being unpressed, except into a little pit beside the Prayer Book,
apparently where her head had rested in kneeling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But where is St. Cleeve?&rsquo; he said, turning in
bewilderment from these evidences of innocent devotion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where can he be?&rsquo; she chimed in, with real
distress.&nbsp; &lsquo;I should so much like to know.&nbsp; Look
about for him.&nbsp; I am quite uneasy!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will, on one condition: that you own that you love
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why should you force me to that?&rsquo; she
murmured.&nbsp; &lsquo;It would be no such wonder if I
did.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, you do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now I&rsquo;ll look for him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Louis took a light, and turned away, astonished that she had
not indignantly resented his intrusion and the nature of his
questioning.</p>
<p>At this moment a slight noise was heard on the staircase, and
they could see a figure rising step by step, and coming forward
against the long lights of the staircase window.&nbsp; It was
Swithin, in his ordinary dress, and carrying his boots in his
hand.&nbsp; When he beheld them standing there so motionless, he
looked rather disconcerted, but came on towards his room.</p>
<p>Lady Constantine was too agitated to speak, but Louis said,
&lsquo;I am glad to see you again.&nbsp; Hearing a noise, a few
minutes ago, I came out to learn what it could be.&nbsp; I found
you absent, and we have been very much alarmed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am very sorry,&rsquo; said Swithin, with
contrition.&nbsp; &lsquo;I owe you a hundred apologies: but the
truth is that on entering my bedroom I found the sky remarkably
clear, and though I told you that the observation I was to make
was of no great consequence, on thinking it over alone I felt it
ought not to be allowed to pass; so I was tempted to run across
to the observatory, and make it, as I had hoped, without
disturbing anybody.&nbsp; If I had known that I should alarm you
I would not have done it for the world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Swithin spoke very earnestly to Louis, and did not observe the
tender reproach in Viviette&rsquo;s eyes when he showed by his
tale his decided notion that the prime use of dark nights lay in
their furtherance of practical astronomy.</p>
<p>Everything being now satisfactorily explained the three
retired to their several chambers, and Louis heard no more noises
that night, or rather morning; his attempts to solve the mystery
of Viviette&rsquo;s life here and her relations with St. Cleeve
having thus far resulted chiefly in perplexity.&nbsp; True, an
admission had been wrung from her; and even without such an
admission it was clear that she had a tender feeling for
Swithin.&nbsp; How to extinguish that romantic folly it now
became his object to consider.</p>
<h3>XXXI</h3>
<p>Swithin&rsquo;s midnight excursion to the tower in the cause
of science led him to oversleep himself, and when the brother and
sister met at breakfast in the morning he did not appear.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t disturb him,&mdash;don&rsquo;t disturb
him,&rsquo; said Louis laconically.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hullo, Viviette,
what are you reading there that makes you flame up so?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She was glancing over a letter that she had just opened, and
at his words looked up with misgiving.</p>
<p>The incident of the previous night left her in great doubt as
to what her bearing towards him ought to be.&nbsp; She had made
no show of resenting his conduct at the time, from a momentary
supposition that he must know all her secret; and afterwards,
finding that he did not know it, it seemed too late to affect
indignation at his suspicions.&nbsp; So she preserved a quiet
neutrality.&nbsp; Even had she resolved on an artificial part she
might have forgotten to play it at this instant, the letter being
of a kind to banish previous considerations.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a letter from Bishop Helmsdale,&rsquo; she
faltered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well done!&nbsp; I hope for your sake it is an
offer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s just what it is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&mdash;surely?&rsquo; said Louis, beginning a laugh
of surprise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she returned indifferently.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You can read it, if you like.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to pry into a communication of that
sort.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, you may read it,&rsquo; she said, tossing the
letter across to him.</p>
<p>Louis thereupon read as under:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span
class="smcap">The Palace</span>, <span
class="smcap">Melchester</span>,<br />
<i>June</i> 28, 18--.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Lady
Constantine</span>,&mdash;During the two or three weeks that have
elapsed since I experienced the great pleasure of renewing my
acquaintance with you, the varied agitation of my feelings has
clearly proved that my only course is to address you by letter,
and at once.&nbsp; Whether the subject of my communication be
acceptable to you or not, I can at least assure you that to
suppress it would be far less natural, and upon the whole less
advisable, than to speak out frankly, even if afterwards I hold
my peace for ever.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The great change in my experience during the past year
or two&mdash;the change, that is, which has resulted from my
advancement to a bishopric&mdash;has frequently suggested to me,
of late, that a discontinuance in my domestic life of the
solitude of past years was a question which ought to be seriously
contemplated.&nbsp; But whether I should ever have contemplated
it without the great good fortune of my meeting with you is
doubtful.&nbsp; However, the thing has been considered at last,
and without more ado I candidly ask if you would be willing to
give up your life at Welland, and relieve my household loneliness
here by becoming my wife.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am far from desiring to force a hurried decision on
your part, and will wait your good pleasure patiently, should you
feel any uncertainty at the moment as to the step.&nbsp; I am
quite disqualified, by habits and experience, for the delightful
procedure of urging my suit in the ardent terms which would be so
appropriate towards such a lady, and so expressive of my inmost
feeling.&nbsp; In truth, a prosy cleric of five-and-forty wants
encouragement to make him eloquent.&nbsp; Of this, however, I can
assure you: that if admiration, esteem, and devotion can
compensate in any way for the lack of those qualities which might
be found to burn with more outward brightness in a younger man,
those it is in my power to bestow for the term of my earthly
life.&nbsp; Your steady adherence to church principles and your
interest in ecclesiastical polity (as was shown by your bright
questioning on those subjects during our morning walk round your
grounds) have indicated strongly to me the grace and
appropriateness with which you would fill the position of a
bishop&rsquo;s wife, and how greatly you would add to his
reputation, should you be disposed to honour him with your
hand.&nbsp; Formerly there have been times when I was of
opinion&mdash;and you will rightly appreciate my candour in
owning it&mdash;that a wife was an impediment to a bishop&rsquo;s
due activities; but constant observation has convinced me that,
far from this being the truth, a meet consort infuses life into
episcopal influence and teaching.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Should you reply in the affirmative I will at once come
to see you, and with your permission will, among other things,
show you a few plain, practical rules which I have interested
myself in drawing up for our future guidance.&nbsp; Should you
refuse to change your condition on my account, your decision
will, as I need hardly say, be a great blow to me.&nbsp; In any
event, I could not do less than I have done, after giving the
subject my full consideration.&nbsp; Even if there be a slight
deficiency of warmth on your part, my earnest hope is that a mind
comprehensive as yours will perceive the immense power for good
that you might exercise in the position in which a union with me
would place you, and allow that perception to weigh in
determining your answer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I remain, my dear Lady Constantine, with the highest
respect and affection,&mdash;Yours always,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">C.
Melchester</span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Well, you will not have the foolhardiness to decline,
now that the question has actually been popped, I should
hope,&rsquo; said Louis, when he had done reading.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly I shall,&rsquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will really be such a flat, Viviette?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You speak without much compliment.&nbsp; I have not the
least idea of accepting him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Surely you will not let your infatuation for that young
fellow carry you so far, after my acquainting you with the shady
side of his character?&nbsp; You call yourself a religious woman,
say your prayers out loud, follow up the revived methods in
church practice, and what not; and yet you can think with
partiality of a person who, far from having any religion in him,
breaks the most elementary commandments in the
decalogue.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot agree with you,&rsquo; she said, turning her
face askance, for she knew not how much of her brother&rsquo;s
language was sincere, and how much assumed, the extent of his
discoveries with regard to her secret ties being a mystery.&nbsp;
At moments she was disposed to declare the whole truth, and have
done with it.&nbsp; But she hesitated, and left the words unsaid;
and Louis continued his breakfast in silence.</p>
<p>When he had finished, and she had eaten little or nothing, he
asked once more, &lsquo;How do you intend to answer that
letter?&nbsp; Here you are, the poorest woman in the county,
abandoned by people who used to be glad to know you, and leading
a life as dismal and dreary as a nun&rsquo;s, when an opportunity
is offered you of leaping at once into a leading position in this
part of England.&nbsp; Bishops are given to hospitality; you
would be welcomed everywhere.&nbsp; In short, your answer must be
yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And yet it will be no,&rsquo; she said, in a low
voice.&nbsp; She had at length learnt, from the tone of her
brother&rsquo;s latter remarks, that at any rate he had no
knowledge of her actual marriage, whatever indirect ties he might
suspect her guilty of.</p>
<p>Louis could restrain himself no longer at her answer.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Then conduct your affairs your own way.&nbsp; I know you
to be leading a life that won&rsquo;t bear investigation, and
I&rsquo;m hanged if I&rsquo;ll stay here any longer!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Saying which, Glanville jerked back his chair, and strode out
of the room.&nbsp; In less than a quarter of an hour, and before
she had moved a step from the table, she heard him leaving the
house.</p>
<h3>XXXII</h3>
<p>What to do she could not tell.&nbsp; The step which Swithin
had entreated her to take, objectionable and premature as it had
seemed in a county aspect, would at all events have saved her
from this dilemma.&nbsp; Had she allowed him to tell the Bishop
his simple story in its fulness, who could say but that that
divine might have generously bridled his own impulses, entered
into the case with sympathy, and forwarded with zest their
designs for the future, owing to his interest of old in
Swithin&rsquo;s father, and in the naturally attractive features
of the young man&rsquo;s career.</p>
<p>A puff of wind from the open window, wafting the
Bishop&rsquo;s letter to the floor, aroused her from her
reverie.&nbsp; With a sigh she stooped and picked it up, glanced
at it again; then arose, and with the deliberateness of
inevitable action wrote her reply:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span
class="smcap">Welland House</span>, <i>June</i> 29, 18--.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Bishop of
Melchester</span>,&mdash;I confess to you that your letter, so
gracious and flattering as it is, has taken your friend somewhat
unawares.&nbsp; The least I can do in return for its contents is
to reply as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is no one in the world who esteems your high
qualities more than myself, or who has greater faith in your
ability to adorn the episcopal seat that you have been called on
to fill.&nbsp; But to your question I can give only one reply,
and that is an unqualified negative.&nbsp; To state this
unavoidable decision distresses me, without affectation; and I
trust you will believe that, though I decline the distinction of
becoming your wife, I shall never cease to interest myself in all
that pertains to you and your office; and shall feel the keenest
regret if this refusal should operate to prevent a lifelong
friendship between us.&mdash;I am, my dear Bishop of Melchester,
ever sincerely yours,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Viviette
Constantine</span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A sudden revulsion from the subterfuge of writing as if she
were still a widow, wrought in her mind a feeling of
dissatisfaction with the whole scheme of concealment; and pushing
aside the letter she allowed it to remain unfolded and
unaddressed.&nbsp; In a few minutes she heard Swithin
approaching, when she put the letter out of the way and turned to
receive him.</p>
<p>Swithin entered quietly, and looked round the room.&nbsp;
Seeing with unexpected pleasure that she was there alone, he came
over and kissed her.&nbsp; Her discomposure at some foregone
event was soon obvious.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Has my staying caused you any trouble?&rsquo; he asked
in a whisper.&nbsp; &lsquo;Where is your brother this
morning?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She smiled through her perplexity as she took his hand.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The oddest things happen to me, dear Swithin,&rsquo; she
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you wish particularly to know what has
happened now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, if you don&rsquo;t mind telling me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do mind telling you.&nbsp; But I must.&nbsp; Among
other things I am resolving to give way to your
representations,&mdash;in part, at least.&nbsp; It will be best
to tell the Bishop everything, and my brother, if not other
people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am truly glad to hear it, Viviette,&rsquo; said he
cheerfully.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have felt for a long time that honesty
is the best policy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I at any rate feel it now.&nbsp; But it is a policy
that requires a great deal of courage!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It certainly requires some courage,&mdash;I should not
say a great deal; and indeed, as far as I am concerned, it
demands less courage to speak out than to hold my
tongue.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, you silly boy, you don&rsquo;t know what has
happened.&nbsp; The Bishop has made me an offer of
marriage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good gracious, what an impertinent old man!&nbsp; What
have you done about it, dearest?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I have hardly accepted him,&rsquo; she replied,
laughing.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is this event which has suggested to me
that I should make my refusal a reason for confiding our
situation to him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What would you have done if you had not been already
appropriated?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s an inscrutable mystery.&nbsp; He is a
worthy man; but he has very pronounced views about his own
position, and some other undesirable qualities.&nbsp; Still, who
knows?&nbsp; You must bless your stars that you have secured
me.&nbsp; Now let us consider how to draw up our confession to
him.&nbsp; I wish I had listened to you at first, and allowed you
to take him into our confidence before his declaration
arrived.&nbsp; He may possibly resent the concealment now.&nbsp;
However, this cannot be helped.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I tell you what, Viviette,&rsquo; said Swithin, after a
thoughtful pause, &lsquo;if the Bishop is such an earthly sort of
man as this, a man who goes falling in love, and wanting to marry
you, and so on, I am not disposed to confess anything to him at
all.&nbsp; I fancied him altogether different from
that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But he&rsquo;s none the worse for it, dear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think he is&mdash;to lecture me and love you, all in
one breath!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Still, that&rsquo;s only a passing phase; and you first
proposed making a confidant of him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did. . . .&nbsp; Very well.&nbsp; Then we are to tell
nobody but the Bishop?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And my brother Louis.&nbsp; I must tell him; it is
unavoidable.&nbsp; He suspects me in a way I could never have
credited of him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Swithin, as was before stated, had arranged to start for
Greenwich that morning, permission having been accorded him by
the Astronomer-Royal to view the Observatory; and their final
decision was that, as he could not afford time to sit down with
her, and write to the Bishop in collaboration, each should,
during the day, compose a well-considered letter, disclosing
their position from his and her own point of view; Lady
Constantine leading up to her confession by her refusal of the
Bishop&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; It was necessary that she should know
what Swithin contemplated saying, that her statements might
precisely harmonize.&nbsp; He ultimately agreed to send her his
letter by the next morning&rsquo;s post, when, having read it,
she would in due course despatch it with her own.</p>
<p>As soon as he had breakfasted Swithin went his way, promising
to return from Greenwich by the end of the week.</p>
<p>Viviette passed the remainder of that long summer day, during
which her young husband was receding towards the capital, in an
almost motionless state.&nbsp; At some instants she felt exultant
at the idea of announcing her marriage and defying general
opinion.&nbsp; At another her heart misgave her, and she was
tormented by a fear lest Swithin should some day accuse her of
having hampered his deliberately-shaped plan of life by her
intrusive romanticism.&nbsp; That was often the trick of men who
had sealed by marriage, in their inexperienced youth, a love for
those whom their maturer judgment would have rejected as too
obviously disproportionate in years.</p>
<p>However, it was now too late for these lugubrious thoughts;
and, bracing herself, she began to frame the new reply to Bishop
Helmsdale&mdash;the plain, unvarnished tale that was to supplant
the undivulging answer first written.&nbsp; She was engaged on
this difficult problem till daylight faded in the west, and the
broad-faced moon edged upwards, like a plate of old gold, over
the elms towards the village.&nbsp; By that time Swithin had
reached Greenwich; her brother had gone she knew not whither; and
she and loneliness dwelt solely, as before, within the walls of
Welland House.</p>
<p>At this hour of sunset and moonrise the new parlourmaid
entered, to inform her that Mr. Cecil&rsquo;s head clerk, from
Warborne, particularly wished to see her.</p>
<p>Mr. Cecil was her solicitor, and she knew of nothing whatever
that required his intervention just at present.&nbsp; But he
would not have sent at this time of day without excellent
reasons, and she directed that the young man might be shown in
where she was.&nbsp; On his entry the first thing she noticed was
that in his hand he carried a newspaper.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In case you should not have seen this evening&rsquo;s
paper, Lady Constantine, Mr. Cecil has directed me to bring it to
you at once, on account of what appears there in relation to your
ladyship.&nbsp; He has only just seen it himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is it?&nbsp; How does it concern me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will point it out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Read it yourself to me.&nbsp; Though I am afraid
there&rsquo;s not enough light.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can see very well here,&rsquo; said the
lawyer&rsquo;s clerk stepping to the window.&nbsp; Folding back
the paper he read:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&lsquo;&ldquo;NEWS FROM
SOUTH AFRICA.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Cape Town</span>, <i>May</i>
17 (<i>vi&acirc;</i> Plymouth).&mdash;A correspondent of the
<i>Cape Chronicle</i> states that he has interviewed an
Englishman just arrived from the interior, and learns from him
that a considerable misapprehension exists in England concerning
the death of the traveller and hunter, Sir Blount
Constantine&mdash;&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;O, he&rsquo;s living!&nbsp; My husband is alive,&rsquo;
she cried, sinking down in nearly a fainting condition.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, my lady.&nbsp; Sir Blount is dead enough, I am
sorry to say.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dead, did you say?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly, Lady Constantine; there is no doubt of
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She sat up, and her intense relief almost made itself
perceptible like a fresh atmosphere in the room.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; Then what did you come for?&rsquo; she asked
calmly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That Sir Blount has died is unquestionable,&rsquo;
replied the lawyer&rsquo;s clerk gently.&nbsp; &lsquo;But there
has been some mistake about the date of his death.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He died of malarious fever on the banks of the Zouga,
October 24, 18--.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No; he only lay ill there a long time it seems.&nbsp;
It was a companion who died at that date.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll
read the account to your ladyship, with your
permission:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;&ldquo;The decease of this somewhat
eccentric wanderer did not occur at the time hitherto supposed,
but only in last December.&nbsp; The following is the account of
the Englishman alluded to, given as nearly as possible in his own
words: During the illness of Sir Blount and his friend by the
Zouga, three of the servants went away, taking with them a
portion of his clothing and effects; and it must be they who
spread the report of his death at this time.&nbsp; After his
companion&rsquo;s death he mended, and when he was strong enough
he and I travelled on to a healthier district.&nbsp; I urged him
not to delay his return to England; but he was much against going
back there again, and became so rough in his manner towards me
that we parted company at the first opportunity I could
find.&nbsp; I joined a party of white traders returning to the
West Coast.&nbsp; I stayed here among the Portuguese for many
months.&nbsp; I then found that an English travelling party were
going to explore a district adjoining that which I had formerly
traversed with Sir Blount.&nbsp; They said they would be glad of
my services, and I joined them.&nbsp; When we had crossed the
territory to the South of Ulunda, and drew near to Marzambo, I
heard tidings of a man living there whom I suspected to be Sir
Blount, although he was not known by that name.&nbsp; Being so
near I was induced to seek him out, and found that he was indeed
the same.&nbsp; He had dropped his old name altogether, and had
married a native princess&mdash;&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Married a native princess!&rsquo; said Lady
Constantine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s what it says, my
lady,&mdash;&ldquo;married a native princess according to the
rites of the tribe, and was living very happily with her.&nbsp;
He told me he should never return to England again.&nbsp; He also
told me that having seen this princess just after I had left him,
he had been attracted by her, and had thereupon decided to reside
with her in that country, as being a land which afforded him
greater happiness than he could hope to attain elsewhere.&nbsp;
He asked me to stay with him, instead of going on with my party,
and not reveal his real title to any of them.&nbsp; After some
hesitation I did stay, and was not uncomfortable at first.&nbsp;
But I soon found that Sir Blount drank much harder now than when
I had known him, and that he was at times very greatly depressed
in mind at his position.&nbsp; One morning in the middle of
December last I heard a shot from his dwelling.&nbsp; His wife
rushed frantically past me as I hastened to the spot, and when I
entered I found that he had put an end to himself with his
revolver.&nbsp; His princess was broken-hearted all that
day.&nbsp; When we had buried him I discovered in his house a
little box directed to his solicitors at Warborne, in England,
and a note for myself, saying that I had better get the first
chance of returning that offered, and requesting me to take the
box with me.&nbsp; It is supposed to contain papers and articles
for friends in England who have deemed him dead for some
time.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>The clerk stopped his reading, and there was a silence.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The middle of last December,&rsquo; she at length said, in
a whisper.&nbsp; &lsquo;Has the box arrived yet?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not yet, my lady.&nbsp; We have no further proof of
anything.&nbsp; As soon as the package comes to hand you shall
know of it immediately.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Such was the clerk&rsquo;s mission; and, leaving the paper
with her, he withdrew.&nbsp; The intelligence amounted to thus
much: that, Sir Blount having been alive till at least six weeks
after her marriage with Swithin St. Cleeve, Swithin St. Cleeve
was not her husband in the eye of the law; that she would have to
consider how her marriage with the latter might be instantly
repeated, to establish herself legally as that young man&rsquo;s
wife.</p>
<h3>XXXIII</h3>
<p>Next morning Viviette received a visit from Mr. Cecil
himself.&nbsp; He informed her that the box spoken of by the
servant had arrived quite unexpectedly just after the departure
of his clerk on the previous evening.&nbsp; There had not been
sufficient time for him to thoroughly examine it as yet, but he
had seen enough to enable him to state that it contained letters,
dated memoranda in Sir Blount&rsquo;s handwriting, notes
referring to events which had happened later than his supposed
death, and other irrefragable proofs that the account in the
newspapers was correct as to the main fact&mdash;the
comparatively recent date of Sir Blount&rsquo;s decease.</p>
<p>She looked up, and spoke with the irresponsible helplessness
of a child.</p>
<p>&lsquo;On reviewing the circumstances, I cannot think how I
could have allowed myself to believe the first tidings!&rsquo;
she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Everybody else believed them, and why should you not
have done so?&rsquo; said the lawyer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How came the will to be permitted to be proved, as
there could, after all, have been no complete evidence?&rsquo;
she asked.&nbsp; &lsquo;If I had been the executrix I would not
have attempted it!&nbsp; As I was not, I know very little about
how the business was pushed through.&nbsp; In a very unseemly
way, I think.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, no,&rsquo; said Mr. Cecil, feeling himself
morally called upon to defend legal procedure from such
imputations.&nbsp; &lsquo;It was done in the usual way in all
cases where the proof of death is only presumptive.&nbsp; The
evidence, such as it was, was laid before the court by the
applicants, your husband&rsquo;s cousins; and the servants who
had been with him deposed to his death with a particularity that
was deemed sufficient.&nbsp; Their error was, not that somebody
died&mdash;for somebody did die at the time affirmed&mdash;but
that they mistook one person for another; the person who died
being not Sir Blount Constantine.&nbsp; The court was of opinion
that the evidence led up to a reasonable inference that the
deceased was actually Sir Blount, and probate was granted on the
strength of it.&nbsp; As there was a doubt about the exact day of
the month, the applicants were allowed to swear that he died on
or after the date last given of his existence&mdash;which, in
spite of their error then, has really come true, now, of
course.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They little think what they have done to me by being so
ready to swear!&rsquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>Mr. Cecil, supposing her to allude only to the pecuniary
straits in which she had been prematurely placed by the will
taking effect a year before its due time, said,
&lsquo;True.&nbsp; It has been to your ladyship&rsquo;s loss, and
to their gain.&nbsp; But they will make ample restitution, no
doubt: and all will be wound up satisfactorily.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lady Constantine was far from explaining that this was not her
meaning; and, after some further conversation of a purely
technical nature, Mr. Cecil left her presence.</p>
<p>When she was again unencumbered with the necessity of
exhibiting a proper bearing, the sense that she had greatly
suffered in pocket by the undue haste of the executors weighed
upon her mind with a pressure quite inappreciable beside the
greater gravity of her personal position.&nbsp; What was her
position as legatee to her situation as a woman?&nbsp; Her face
crimsoned with a flush which she was almost ashamed to show to
the daylight, as she hastily penned the following note to Swithin
at Greenwich&mdash;certainly one of the most informal documents
she had ever written.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span
class="smcap">Welland</span>, <i>Thursday</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Swithin, my dear Swithin, what I have to tell you is
so sad and so humiliating that I can hardly write it&mdash;and
yet I must.&nbsp; Though we are dearer to each other than all the
world besides, and as firmly united as if we were one, I am not
legally your wife!&nbsp; Sir Blount did not die till some time
after we in England supposed.&nbsp; The service must be repeated
instantly.&nbsp; I have not been able to sleep all night.&nbsp; I
feel so frightened and ashamed that I can scarcely arrange my
thoughts.&nbsp; The newspapers sent with this will explain, if
you have not seen particulars.&nbsp; Do come to me as soon as you
can, that we may consult on what to do.&nbsp; Burn this at
once.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;Your <span
class="smcap">Viviette</span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the note was despatched she remembered that there was
another hardly less important question to be answered&mdash;the
proposal of the Bishop for her hand.&nbsp; His communication had
sunk into nothingness beside the momentous news that had so
greatly distressed her.&nbsp; The two replies lay before
her&mdash;the one she had first written, simply declining to
become Dr. Helmsdale&rsquo;s wife, without giving reasons; the
second, which she had elaborated with so much care on the
previous day, relating in confidential detail the history of her
love for Swithin, their secret marriage, and their hopes for the
future; asking his advice on what their procedure should be to
escape the strictures of a censorious world.&nbsp; It was the
letter she had barely finished writing when Mr. Cecil&rsquo;s
clerk announced news tantamount to a declaration that she was no
wife at all.</p>
<p>This epistle she now destroyed&mdash;and with the less
reluctance in knowing that Swithin had been somewhat averse to
the confession as soon as he found that Bishop Helmsdale was also
a victim to tender sentiment concerning her.&nbsp; The first, in
which, at the time of writing, the <i>suppressio veri</i> was too
strong for her conscience, had now become an honest letter, and
sadly folding it she sent the missive on its way.</p>
<p>The sense of her undefinable position kept her from much
repose on the second night also; but the following morning
brought an unexpected letter from Swithin, written about the same
hour as hers to him, and it comforted her much.</p>
<p>He had seen the account in the papers almost as soon as it had
come to her knowledge, and sent this line to reassure her in the
perturbation she must naturally feel.&nbsp; She was not to be
alarmed at all.&nbsp; They two were husband and wife in moral
intent and antecedent belief, and the legal flaw which accident
had so curiously uncovered could be mended in half-an-hour.&nbsp;
He would return on Saturday night at latest, but as the hour
would probably be far advanced, he would ask her to meet him by
slipping out of the house to the tower any time during service on
Sunday morning, when there would be few persons about likely to
observe them.&nbsp; Meanwhile he might provisionally state that
their best course in the emergency would be, instead of
confessing to anybody that there had already been a solemnization
of marriage between them, to arrange their re-marriage in as open
a manner as possible&mdash;as if it were the just-reached climax
of a sudden affection, instead of a harking back to an old
departure&mdash;prefacing it by a public announcement in the
usual way.</p>
<p>This plan of approaching their second union with all the show
and circumstance of a new thing, recommended itself to her
strongly, but for one objection&mdash;that by such a course the
wedding could not, without appearing like an act of unseemly
haste, take place so quickly as she desired for her own moral
satisfaction.&nbsp; It might take place somewhat early, say in
the course of a month or two, without bringing down upon her the
charge of levity; for Sir Blount, a notoriously unkind husband,
had been out of her sight four years, and in his grave nearly
one.&nbsp; But what she naturally desired was that there should
be no more delay than was positively necessary for obtaining a
new license&mdash;two or three days at longest; and in view of
this celerity it was next to impossible to make due preparation
for a wedding of ordinary publicity, performed in her own church,
from her own house, with a feast and amusements for the
villagers, a tea for the school children, a bonfire, and other of
those proclamatory accessories which, by meeting wonder half-way,
deprive it of much of its intensity.&nbsp; It must be admitted,
too, that she even now shrank from the shock of surprise that
would inevitably be caused by her openly taking for husband such
a mere youth of no position as Swithin still appeared,
notwithstanding that in years he was by this time within a trifle
of one-and-twenty.</p>
<p>The straightforward course had, nevertheless, so much to
recommend it, so well avoided the disadvantage of future
revelation which a private repetition of the ceremony would
entail, that assuming she could depend upon Swithin, as she knew
she could do, good sense counselled its serious
consideration.</p>
<p>She became more composed at her queer situation: hour after
hour passed, and the first spasmodic impulse of womanly
decorum&mdash;not to let the sun go down upon her present
improper state&mdash;was quite controllable.&nbsp; She could
regard the strange contingency that had arisen with something
like philosophy.&nbsp; The day slipped by: she thought of the
awkwardness of the accident rather than of its humiliation; and,
loving Swithin now in a far calmer spirit than at that past date
when they had rushed into each other&rsquo;s arms and vowed to be
one for the first time, she ever and anon caught herself
reflecting, &lsquo;Were it not that for my honour&rsquo;s sake I
must re-marry him, I should perhaps be a nobler woman in not
allowing him to encumber his bright future by a union with me at
all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This thought, at first artificially raised, as little more
than a mental exercise, became by stages a genuine conviction;
and while her heart enforced, her reason regretted the necessity
of abstaining from self-sacrifice&mdash;the being obliged,
despite his curious escape from the first attempt, to lime
Swithin&rsquo;s young wings again solely for her credit&rsquo;s
sake.</p>
<p>However, the deed had to be done; Swithin was to be made
legally hers.&nbsp; Selfishness in a conjuncture of this sort was
excusable, and even obligatory.&nbsp; Taking brighter views, she
hoped that upon the whole this yoking of the young fellow with
her, a portionless woman and his senior, would not greatly
endanger his career.&nbsp; In such a mood night overtook her, and
she went to bed conjecturing that Swithin had by this time
arrived in the parish, was perhaps even at that moment passing
homeward beneath her walls, and that in less than twelve hours
she would have met him, have ventilated the secret which
oppressed her, and have satisfactorily arranged with him the
details of their reunion.</p>
<h3>XXXIV</h3>
<p>Sunday morning came, and complicated her previous emotions by
bringing a new and unexpected shock to mingle with them.&nbsp;
The postman had delivered among other things an illustrated
newspaper, sent by a hand she did not recognize; and on opening
the cover the sheet that met her eyes filled her with a horror
which she could not express.&nbsp; The print was one which drew
largely on its imagination for its engravings, and it already
contained an illustration of the death of Sir Blount
Constantine.&nbsp; In this work of art he was represented as
standing with his pistol to his mouth, his brains being in
process of flying up to the roof of his chamber, and his native
princess rushing terror-stricken away to a remote position in the
thicket of palms which neighboured the dwelling.</p>
<p>The crude realism of the picture, possibly harmless enough in
its effect upon others, overpowered and sickened her.&nbsp; By a
curious fascination she would look at it again and again, till
every line of the engraver&rsquo;s performance seemed really a
transcript from what had happened before his eyes.&nbsp; With
such details fresh in her thoughts she was going out of the door
to make arrangements for confirming, by repetition, her marriage
with another.&nbsp; No interval was available for serious
reflection on the tragedy, or for allowing the softening effects
of time to operate in her mind.&nbsp; It was as though her first
husband had died that moment, and she was keeping an appointment
with another in the presence of his corpse.</p>
<p>So revived was the actuality of Sir Blount&rsquo;s recent life
and death by this incident, that the distress of her personal
relations with Swithin was the single force in the world which
could have coerced her into abandoning to him the interval she
would fain have set apart for getting over these new and painful
impressions.&nbsp; Self-pity for ill-usage afforded her good
reasons for ceasing to love Sir Blount; but he was yet too
closely intertwined with her past life to be destructible on the
instant as a memory.</p>
<p>But there was no choice of occasions for her now, and she
steadily waited for the church bells to cease chiming.&nbsp; At
last all was silent; the surrounding cottagers had gathered
themselves within the walls of the adjacent building.&nbsp;
Tabitha Lark&rsquo;s first voluntary then droned from the tower
window, and Lady Constantine left the garden in which she had
been loitering, and went towards Rings-Hill Speer.</p>
<p>The sense of her situation obscured the morning
prospect.&nbsp; The country was unusually silent under the
intensifying sun, the songless season of birds having just set
in.&nbsp; Choosing her path amid the efts that were basking upon
the outer slopes of the plantation she wound her way up the
tree-shrouded camp to the wooden cabin in the centre.</p>
<p>The door was ajar, but on entering she found the place
empty.&nbsp; The tower door was also partly open; and listening
at the foot of the stairs she heard Swithin above, shifting the
telescope and wheeling round the rumbling dome, apparently in
preparation for the next nocturnal reconnoitre.&nbsp; There was
no doubt that he would descend in a minute or two to look for
her, and not wishing to interrupt him till he was ready she
re-entered the cabin, where she patiently seated herself among
the books and papers that lay scattered about.</p>
<p>She did as she had often done before when waiting there for
him; that is, she occupied her moments in turning over the papers
and examining the progress of his labours.&nbsp; The notes were
mostly astronomical, of course, and she had managed to keep
sufficiently abreast of him to catch the meaning of a good many
of these.&nbsp; The litter on the table, however, was somewhat
more marked this morning than usual, as if it had been hurriedly
overhauled.&nbsp; Among the rest of the sheets lay an open note,
and, in the entire confidence that existed between them, she
glanced over and read it as a matter of course.</p>
<p>It was a most business-like communication, and beyond the
address and date contained only the following words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear
Sir</span>,&mdash;We beg leave to draw your attention to a letter
we addressed to you on the 26th ult., to which we have not yet
been favoured with a reply.&nbsp; As the time for payment of the
first moiety of the six hundred pounds per annum settled on you
by your late uncle is now at hand, we should be obliged by your
giving directions as to where and in what manner the money is to
be handed over to you, and shall also be glad to receive any
other definite instructions from you with regard to the
future.&mdash;We are, dear Sir, yours faithfully,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Hanner And
Rawles</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Swithin St. Cleeve</span>,
Esq.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An income of six hundred a year for Swithin, whom she had
hitherto understood to be possessed of an annuity of eighty
pounds at the outside, with no prospect of increasing the sum but
by hard work!&nbsp; What could this communication mean?&nbsp; He
whose custom and delight it was to tell her all his heart, had
breathed not a syllable of this matter to her, though it met the
very difficulty towards which their discussions invariably
tended&mdash;how to secure for him a competency that should
enable him to establish his pursuits on a wider basis, and throw
himself into more direct communion with the scientific
world.&nbsp; Quite bewildered by the lack of any explanation she
rose from her seat, and with the note in her hand ascended the
winding tower-steps.</p>
<p>Reaching the upper aperture she perceived him under the dome,
moving musingly about as if he had never been absent an hour, his
light hair frilling out from under the edge of his velvet
skull-cap as it was always wont to do.&nbsp; No question of
marriage seemed to be disturbing the mind of this juvenile
husband of hers.&nbsp; The <i>primum mobile</i> of his
gravitation was apparently the equatorial telescope which she had
given him, and which he was carefully adjusting by means of
screws and clamps.&nbsp; Hearing her movements he turned his
head.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O here you are, my dear Viviette!&nbsp; I was just
beginning to expect you,&rsquo; he exclaimed, coming
forward.&nbsp; &lsquo;I ought to have been looking out for you,
but I have found a little defect here in the instrument, and I
wanted to set it right before evening comes on.&nbsp; As a rule
it is not a good thing to tinker your glasses; but I have found
that the diffraction-rings are not perfect circles.&nbsp; I
learnt at Greenwich how to correct them&mdash;so kind they have
been to me there!&mdash;and so I have been loosening the screws
and gently shifting the glass, till I think that I have at last
made the illumination equal all round.&nbsp; I have so much to
tell you about my visit; one thing is, that the astronomical
world is getting quite excited about the coming Transit of
Venus.&nbsp; There is to be a regular expedition fitted
out.&nbsp; How I should like to join it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He spoke enthusiastically, and with eyes sparkling at the
mental image of the said expedition; and as it was rather gloomy
in the dome he rolled it round on its axis, till the shuttered
slit for the telescope directly faced the morning sun, which
thereupon flooded the concave interior, touching the bright
metal-work of the equatorial, and lighting up her pale, troubled
face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But Swithin!&rsquo; she faltered; &lsquo;my letter to
you&mdash;our marriage!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes, this marriage question,&rsquo; he added.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I had not forgotten it, dear Viviette&mdash;or at least
only for a few minutes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can you forget it, Swithin, for a moment?&nbsp; O how
can you!&rsquo; she said reproachfully.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is such a
distressing thing.&nbsp; It drives away all my rest!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Forgotten is not the word I should have used,&rsquo; he
apologized.&nbsp; &lsquo;Temporarily dismissed it from my mind,
is all I meant.&nbsp; The simple fact is, that the vastness of
the field of astronomy reduces every terrestrial thing to atomic
dimensions.&nbsp; Do not trouble, dearest.&nbsp; The remedy is
quite easy, as I stated in my letter.&nbsp; We can now be married
in a prosy public way.&nbsp; Yes, early or late&mdash;next week,
next month, six months hence&mdash;just as you choose.&nbsp; Say
the word when, and I will obey.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The absence of all anxiety or consternation from his face
contrasted strangely with hers, which at last he saw, and,
looking at the writing she held, inquired&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But what paper have you in your hand?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A letter which to me is actually inexplicable,&rsquo;
said she, her curiosity returning to the letter, and overriding
for the instant her immediate concerns.&nbsp; &lsquo;What does
this income of six hundred a year mean?&nbsp; Why have you never
told me about it, dear Swithin? or does it not refer to
you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He looked at the note, flushed slightly, and was absolutely
unable to begin his reply at once.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not mean you to see that, Viviette,&rsquo; he
murmured.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought you had better not, as it does not concern me
further now.&nbsp; The solicitors are labouring under a mistake
in supposing that it does.&nbsp; I have to write at once and
inform them that the annuity is not mine to receive.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a strange mystery in your life!&rsquo; she said,
forcing a perplexed smile.&nbsp; &lsquo;Something to balance the
tragedy in mine.&nbsp; I am absolutely in the dark as to your
past history, it seems.&nbsp; And yet I had thought you told me
everything.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I could not tell you that, Viviette, because it would
have endangered our relations&mdash;though not in the way you may
suppose.&nbsp; You would have reproved me.&nbsp; You, who are so
generous and noble, would have forbidden me to do what I did; and
I was determined not to be forbidden.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To do what?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To marry you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why should I have forbidden?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Must I tell&mdash;what I would not?&rsquo; he said,
placing his hands upon her arms, and looking somewhat sadly at
her.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, perhaps as it has come to this you ought
to know all, since it can make no possible difference to my
intentions now.&nbsp; We are one for ever&mdash;legal blunders
notwithstanding; for happily they are quickly reparable&mdash;and
this question of a devise from my uncle Jocelyn only concerned me
when I was a single man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon, with obviously no consideration of the
possibilities that were reopened of the nullity of their marriage
contract, he related in detail, and not without misgiving for
having concealed them so long, the events that had occurred on
the morning of their wedding-day; how he had met the postman on
his way to Warborne after dressing in the cabin, and how he had
received from him the letter his dead uncle had confided to his
family lawyers, informing him of the annuity, and of the
important request attached&mdash;that he should remain unmarried
until his five-and-twentieth year; how in comparison with the
possession of her dear self he had reckoned the income as nought,
abandoned all idea of it there and then, and had come on to the
wedding as if nothing had happened to interrupt for a moment the
working out of their plan; how he had scarcely thought with any
closeness of the circumstances of the case since, until reminded
of them by this note she had seen, and a previous one of a like
sort received from the same solicitors.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Swithin! Swithin!&rsquo; she cried, bursting into
tears as she realized it all, and sinking on the observing-chair;
&lsquo;I have ruined you! yes, I have ruined you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The young man was dismayed by her unexpected grief, and
endeavoured to soothe her; but she seemed touched by a poignant
remorse which would not be comforted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And now,&rsquo; she continued, as soon as she could
speak, &lsquo;when you are once more free, and in a
position&mdash;actually in a position to claim the annuity that
would be the making of you, I am compelled to come to you, and
beseech you to undo yourself again, merely to save me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not to save you, Viviette, but to bless me.&nbsp; You
do not ask me to re-marry; it is not a question of alternatives
at all; it is my straight course.&nbsp; I do not dream of doing
otherwise.&nbsp; I should be wretched if you thought for one
moment I could entertain the idea of doing otherwise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the more he said the worse he made the matter.&nbsp; It
was a state of affairs that would not bear discussion at all, and
the unsophisticated view he took of his course seemed to increase
her responsibility.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why did your uncle attach such a cruel condition to his
bounty?&rsquo; she cried bitterly.&nbsp; &lsquo;O, he little
thinks how hard he hits me from the grave&mdash;me, who have
never done him wrong; and you, too!&nbsp; Swithin, are you sure
that he makes that condition indispensable?&nbsp; Perhaps he
meant that you should not marry beneath you; perhaps he did not
mean to object in such a case as your marrying (forgive me for
saying it) a little above you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is no doubt that he did not contemplate a case
which has led to such happiness as this has done,&rsquo; the
youth murmured with hesitation; for though he scarcely remembered
a word of his uncle&rsquo;s letter of advice, he had a dim
apprehension that it was couched in terms alluding specifically
to Lady Constantine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you sure you cannot retain the money, and be my
lawful husband too?&rsquo; she asked piteously.&nbsp; &lsquo;O,
what a wrong I am doing you!&nbsp; I did not dream that it could
be as bad as this.&nbsp; I knew I was wasting your time by
letting you love me, and hampering your projects; but I thought
there were compensating advantages.&nbsp; This wrecking of your
future at my hands I did not contemplate.&nbsp; You are sure
there is no escape?&nbsp; Have you his letter with the
conditions, or the will?&nbsp; Let me see the letter in which he
expresses his wishes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I assure you it is all as I say,&rsquo; he pensively
returned.&nbsp; &lsquo;Even if I were not legally bound by the
conditions I should be morally.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But how does he put it?&nbsp; How does he justify
himself in making such a harsh restriction?&nbsp; Do let me see
the letter, Swithin.&nbsp; I shall think it a want of confidence
if you do not.&nbsp; I may discover some way out of the
difficulty if you let me look at the papers.&nbsp; Eccentric
wills can be evaded in all sorts of ways.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Still he hesitated.&nbsp; &lsquo;I would rather you did not
see the papers,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>But she persisted as only a fond woman can.&nbsp; Her
conviction was that she who, as a woman many years his senior,
should have shown her love for him by guiding him straight into
the paths he aimed at, had blocked his attempted career for her
own happiness.&nbsp; This made her more intent than ever to find
out a device by which, while she still retained him, he might
also retain the life-interest under his uncle&rsquo;s will.</p>
<p>Her entreaties were at length too potent for his
resistance.&nbsp; Accompanying her downstairs to the cabin, he
opened the desk from which the other papers had been taken, and
against his better judgment handed her the ominous communication
of Jocelyn St. Cleeve which lay in the envelope just as it had
been received three-quarters of a year earlier.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t read it now,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t spoil our meeting by entering into a subject
which is virtually past and done with.&nbsp; Take it with you,
and look it over at your leisure&mdash;merely as an old
curiosity, remember, and not as a still operative document.&nbsp;
I have almost forgotten what the contents are, beyond the general
advice and stipulation that I was to remain a
bachelor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;At any rate,&rsquo; she rejoined, &lsquo;do not reply
to the note I have seen from the solicitors till I have read this
also.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He promised.&nbsp; &lsquo;But now about our public
wedding,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Like certain royal
personages, we shall have had the religious rite and the civil
contract performed on independent occasions.&nbsp; Will you fix
the day?&nbsp; When is it to be? and shall it take place at a
registrar&rsquo;s office, since there is no necessity for having
the sacred part over again?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll think,&rsquo; replied she.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll think it over.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And let me know as soon as you can how you decide to
proceed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will write to-morrow, or come.&nbsp; I do not know
what to say now.&nbsp; I cannot forget how I am wronging
you.&nbsp; This is almost more than I can bear!&rsquo;</p>
<p>To divert her mind he began talking about Greenwich
Observatory, and the great instruments therein, and how he had
been received by the astronomers, and the details of the
expedition to observe the Transit of Venus, together with many
other subjects of the sort, to which she had not power to lend
her attention.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must reach home before the people are out of
church,&rsquo; she at length said wearily.&nbsp; &lsquo;I wish
nobody to know I have been out this morning.&rsquo;&nbsp; And
forbidding Swithin to cross into the open in her company she left
him on the edge of the isolated plantation, which had latterly
known her tread so well.</p>
<h3>XXXV</h3>
<p>Lady Constantine crossed the field and the park beyond, and
found on passing the church that the congregation was still
within.&nbsp; There was no hurry for getting indoors, the open
windows enabling her to hear that Mr. Torkingham had only just
given out his text.&nbsp; So instead of entering the house she
went through the garden-door to the old bowling-green, and sat
down in the arbour that Louis had occupied when he overheard the
interview between Swithin and the Bishop.&nbsp; Not until then
did she find courage to draw out the letter and papers relating
to the bequest, which Swithin in a critical moment had handed to
her.</p>
<p>Had he been ever so little older he would not have placed that
unconsidered confidence in Viviette which had led him to give way
to her curiosity.&nbsp; But the influence over him which eight or
nine outnumbering years lent her was immensely increased by her
higher position and wider experiences, and he had yielded the
point, as he yielded all social points; while the same conditions
exempted him from any deep consciousness that it was his duty to
protect her even from herself.</p>
<p>The preamble of Dr. St. Cleeve&rsquo;s letter, in which he
referred to his pleasure at hearing of the young man&rsquo;s
promise as an astronomer, disturbed her not at all&mdash;indeed,
somewhat prepossessed her in favour of the old gentleman who had
written it.&nbsp; The first item of what he called
&lsquo;unfavourable news,&rsquo; namely, the allusion to the
inadequacy of Swithin&rsquo;s income to the wants of a scientific
man, whose lines of work were not calculated to produce pecuniary
emolument for many years, deepened the cast of her face to
concern.&nbsp; She reached the second item of the so-called
unfavourable news; and her face flushed as she read how the
doctor had learnt &lsquo;that there was something in your path
worse than narrow means, and that something is a
woman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To save you, if possible, from ruin on these
heads,&rsquo; she read on, &lsquo;I take the preventive measures
entailed below.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And then followed the announcement of the 600 pounds a year
settled on the youth for life, on the single condition that he
remained unmarried till the age of twenty-five&mdash;just as
Swithin had explained to her.&nbsp; She next learnt that the
bequest was for a definite object&mdash;that he might have
resources sufficient to enable him to travel in an inexpensive
way, and begin a study of the southern constellations, which,
according to the shrewd old man&rsquo;s judgment, were a mine not
so thoroughly worked as the northern, and therefore to be
recommended.&nbsp; This was followed by some sentences which hit
her in the face like a switch:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The only other preventive step in my power is that of
exhortation. . . .&nbsp; Swithin St. Cleeve, don&rsquo;t make a
fool of yourself, as your father did.&nbsp; If your studies are
to be worth anything, believe me they must be carried on without
the help of a woman.&nbsp; Avoid her, and every one of the sex,
if you mean to achieve any worthy thing.&nbsp; Eschew all of that
sort for many a year yet.&nbsp; Moreover, I say, the lady of your
acquaintance avoid in particular. . . .&nbsp; She has, in
addition to her original disqualification as a companion for you
(that is, that of sex), these two special drawbacks: she is much
older than yourself&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lady Constantine&rsquo;s indignant flush forsook her, and pale
despair succeeded in its stead.&nbsp; Alas, it was true.&nbsp;
Handsome, and in her prime, she might be; but she was too old for
Swithin!</p>
<p>&lsquo;And she is so impoverished. . . .&nbsp; Beyond this,
frankly, I don&rsquo;t think well of her.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
think well of any woman who dotes upon a man younger than
herself. . . .&nbsp; To care to be the first fancy of a young
fellow like you shows no great common sense in her.&nbsp; If she
were worth her salt she would have too much pride to be intimate
with a youth in your unassured position, to say no
more.&rsquo;&nbsp; (Viviette&rsquo;s face by this time tingled
hot again.)&nbsp; &lsquo;She is old enough to know that a liaison
with her may, and almost certainly would, be your ruin; and, on
the other hand, that a marriage would be
preposterous&mdash;unless she is a complete fool; and in that
case there is even more reason for avoiding her than if she were
in her few senses.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A woman of honourable feeling, nephew, would be careful
to do nothing to hinder you in your career, as this putting of
herself in your way most certainly will.&nbsp; Yet I hear that
she professes a great anxiety on this same future of yours as a
physicist.&nbsp; The best way in which she can show the reality
of her anxiety is by leaving you to yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Leaving him to himself!&nbsp; She paled again, as if chilled
by a conviction that in this the old man was right.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;ll blab your most secret plans and theories
to every one of her acquaintance, and make you appear ridiculous
by announcing them before they are matured.&nbsp; If you attempt
to study with a woman, you&rsquo;ll be ruled by her to entertain
fancies instead of theories, air-castles instead of intentions,
qualms instead of opinions, sickly prepossessions instead of
reasoned conclusions. . . .</p>
<p>&lsquo;An experienced woman waking a young man&rsquo;s
passions just at a moment when he is endeavouring to shine
intellectually, is doing little less than committing a
crime.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Thus much the letter; and it was enough for her, indeed.&nbsp;
The flushes of indignation which had passed over her, as she
gathered this man&rsquo;s opinion of herself, combined with
flushes of grief and shame when she considered that
Swithin&mdash;her dear Swithin&mdash;was perfectly acquainted
with this cynical view of her nature; that, reject it as he
might, and as he unquestionably did, such thoughts of her had
been implanted in him, and lay in him.&nbsp; Stifled as they
were, they lay in him like seeds too deep for germination, which
accident might some day bring near the surface and a&euml;rate
into life.</p>
<p>The humiliation of such a possibility was almost too much to
endure; the mortification&mdash;she had known nothing like it
till now.&nbsp; But this was not all.&nbsp; There succeeded a
feeling in comparison with which resentment and mortification
were happy moods&mdash;a miserable conviction that this old man
who spoke from the grave was not altogether wrong in his
speaking; that he was only half wrong; that he was, perhaps,
virtually right.&nbsp; Only those persons who are by nature
affected with that ready esteem for others&rsquo; positions which
induces an undervaluing of their own, fully experience the deep
smart of such convictions against self&mdash;the wish for
annihilation that is engendered in the moment of despair, at
feeling that at length we, our best and firmest friend, cease to
believe in our cause.</p>
<p>Viviette could hear the people coming out of church on the
other side of the garden wall.&nbsp; Their footsteps and their
cheerful voices died away; the bell rang for lunch; and she went
in.&nbsp; But her life during that morning and afternoon was
wholly introspective.&nbsp; Knowing the full circumstances of his
situation as she knew them now&mdash;as she had never before
known them&mdash;ought she to make herself the legal wife of
Swithin St. Cleeve, and so secure her own honour at any price to
him? such was the formidable question which Lady Constantine
propounded to her startled understanding.&nbsp; As a subjectively
honest woman alone, beginning her charity at home, there was no
doubt that she ought.&nbsp; Save Thyself was sound Old Testament
doctrine, and not altogether discountenanced in the New.&nbsp;
But was there a line of conduct which transcended mere
self-preservation? and would it not be an excellent thing to put
it in practice now?</p>
<p>That she had wronged St. Cleeve by marrying him&mdash;that she
would wrong him infinitely more by completing the
marriage&mdash;there was, in her opinion, no doubt.&nbsp; She in
her experience had sought out him in his inexperience, and had
led him like a child.&nbsp; She remembered&mdash;as if it had
been her fault, though it was in fact only her
misfortune&mdash;that she had been the one to go for the license
and take up residence in the parish in which they were
wedded.&nbsp; He was now just one-and-twenty.&nbsp; Without her,
he had all the world before him, six hundred a year, and leave to
cut as straight a road to fame as he should choose: with her,
this story was negatived.</p>
<p>No money from his uncle; no power of advancement; but a
bondage with a woman whose disparity of years, though immaterial
just now, would operate in the future as a wet blanket upon his
social ambitions; and that content with life as it was which she
had noticed more than once in him latterly, a content imperilling
his scientific spirit by abstracting his zeal for progress.</p>
<p>It was impossible, in short, to blind herself to the inference
that marriage with her had not benefited him.&nbsp; Matters might
improve in the future; but to take upon herself the whole
liability of Swithin&rsquo;s life, as she would do by depriving
him of the help his uncle had offered, was a fearful
responsibility.&nbsp; How could she, an unendowed woman, replace
such assistance?&nbsp; His recent visit to Greenwich, which had
momentarily revived that zest for his pursuit that was now less
constant than heretofore, should by rights be supplemented by
other such expeditions.&nbsp; It would be true benevolence not to
deprive him of means to continue them, so as to keep his ardour
alive, regardless of the cost to herself.</p>
<p>It could be done.&nbsp; By the extraordinary favour of a
unique accident she had now an opportunity of redeeming
Swithin&rsquo;s seriously compromised future, and restoring him
to a state no worse than his first.&nbsp; His annuity could be
enjoyed by him, his travels undertaken, his studies pursued, his
high vocation initiated, by one little sacrifice&mdash;that of
herself.&nbsp; She only had to refuse to legalize their marriage,
to part from him for ever, and all would be well with him
thenceforward.&nbsp; The pain to him would after all be but
slight, whatever it might be to his wretched Viviette.</p>
<p>The ineptness of retaining him at her side lay not only in the
fact itself of injury to him, but in the likelihood of his living
to see it as such, and reproaching her for selfishness in not
letting him go in this unprecedented opportunity for correcting a
move proved to be false.&nbsp; He wished to examine the southern
heavens&mdash;perhaps his uncle&rsquo;s letter was the father of
the wish&mdash;and there was no telling what good might not
result to mankind at large from his exploits there.&nbsp; Why
should she, to save her narrow honour, waste the wide promise of
his ability?</p>
<p>That in immolating herself by refusing him, and leaving him
free to work wonders for the good of his fellow-creatures, she
would in all probability add to the sum of human felicity,
consoled her by its breadth as an idea even while it tortured her
by making herself the scapegoat or single unit on whom the evil
would fall.&nbsp; Ought a possibly large number, Swithin
included, to remain unbenefited because the one individual to
whom his release would be an injury chanced to be herself?&nbsp;
Love between man and woman, which in Homer, Moses, and other
early exhibitors of life, is mere desire, had for centuries past
so far broadened as to include sympathy and friendship; surely it
should in this advanced stage of the world include benevolence
also.&nbsp; If so, it was her duty to set her young man free.</p>
<p>Thus she laboured, with a generosity more worthy even than its
object, to sink her love for her own decorum in devotion to the
world in general, and to Swithin in particular.&nbsp; To counsel
her activities by her understanding, rather than by her emotions
as usual, was hard work for a tender woman; but she strove hard,
and made advance.&nbsp; The self-centred attitude natural to one
in her situation was becoming displaced by the sympathetic
attitude, which, though it had to be artificially fostered at
first, gave her, by degrees, a certain sweet sense that she was
rising above self-love.&nbsp; That maternal element which had
from time to time evinced itself in her affection for the youth,
and was imparted by her superior ripeness in experience and
years, appeared now again, as she drew nearer the resolve not to
secure propriety in her own social condition at the expense of
this youth&rsquo;s earthly utility.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly grand fruits are sometimes forced forth by harsh
pruning.&nbsp; The illiberal letter of Swithin&rsquo;s uncle was
suggesting to Lady Constantine an altruism whose thoroughness
would probably have amazed that queer old gentleman into a
withdrawal of the conditions that had induced it.&nbsp; To love
St. Cleeve so far better than herself as this was to surpass the
love of women as conventionally understood, and as mostly
existing.</p>
<p>Before, however, clinching her decision by any definite step
she worried her little brain by devising every kind of ingenious
scheme, in the hope of lighting on one that might show her how
that decision could be avoided with the same good result.&nbsp;
But to secure for him the advantages offered, and to retain him
likewise; reflection only showed it to be impossible.</p>
<p>Yet to let him go <i>for ever</i> was more than she could
endure, and at length she jumped at an idea which promised some
sort of improvement on that design.&nbsp; She would propose that
reunion should not be entirely abandoned, but simply
postponed&mdash;namely, till after his twenty-fifth
birthday&mdash;when he might be her husband without, at any rate,
the loss to him of the income.&nbsp; By this time he would
approximate to a man&rsquo;s full judgment, and that painful
aspect of her as one who had deluded his raw immaturity would
have passed for ever.</p>
<p>The plan somewhat appeased her disquieted honour.&nbsp; To let
a marriage sink into abeyance for four or five years was not to
nullify it; and though she would leave it to him to move its
substantiation at the end of that time, without present
stipulations, she had not much doubt upon the issue.</p>
<p>The clock struck five.&nbsp; This silent mental debate had
occupied her whole afternoon.&nbsp; Perhaps it would not have
ended now but for an unexpected incident&mdash;the entry of her
brother Louis.&nbsp; He came into the room where she was sitting,
or rather writhing, and after a few words to explain how he had
got there and about the mistake in the date of Sir Blount&rsquo;s
death, he walked up close to her.&nbsp; His next remarks were
apologetic in form, but in essence they were bitterness
itself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Viviette,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I am sorry for my
hasty words to you when I last left this house.&nbsp; I readily
withdraw them.&nbsp; My suspicions took a wrong direction.&nbsp;
I think now that I know the truth.&nbsp; You have been even
madder than I supposed!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In what way?&rsquo; she asked distantly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I lately thought that unhappy young man was only your
too-favoured lover.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You thought wrong: he is not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is not&mdash;I believe you&mdash;for he is
more.&nbsp; I now am persuaded that he is your lawful
husband.&nbsp; Can you deny it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;On your sacred word!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;On my sacred word he is not that either.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank heaven for that assurance!&rsquo; said Louis,
exhaling a breath of relief.&nbsp; &lsquo;I was not so positive
as I pretended to be&mdash;but I wanted to know the truth of this
mystery.&nbsp; Since you are not fettered to him in that way I
care nothing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Louis turned away; and that afforded her an opportunity for
leaving the room.&nbsp; Those few words were the last grains that
had turned the balance, and settled her doom.</p>
<p>She would let Swithin go.&nbsp; All the voices in her world
seemed to clamour for that consummation.&nbsp; The
morning&rsquo;s mortification, the afternoon&rsquo;s benevolence,
and the evening&rsquo;s instincts of evasion had joined to carry
the point.</p>
<p>Accordingly she sat down, and wrote to Swithin a summary of
the thoughts above detailed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We shall separate,&rsquo; she concluded.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You to obey your uncle&rsquo;s orders and explore the
southern skies; I to wait as one who can implicitly trust
you.&nbsp; Do not see me again till the years have expired.&nbsp;
You will find me still the same.&nbsp; I am your wife through all
time; the letter of the law is not needed to reassert it at
present; while the absence of the letter secures your
fortune.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nothing can express what it cost Lady Constantine to marshal
her arguments; but she did it, and vanquished self-comfort by a
sense of the general expediency.&nbsp; It may unhesitatingly be
affirmed that the only ignoble reason which might have dictated
such a step was non-existent; that is to say, a serious decline
in her affection.&nbsp; Tenderly she had loved the youth at
first, and tenderly she loved him now, as time and her
after-conduct proved.</p>
<p>Women the most delicate get used to strange moral
situations.&nbsp; Eve probably regained her normal sweet
composure about a week after the Fall.&nbsp; On first learning of
her anomalous position Lady Constantine had blushed hot, and her
pure instincts had prompted her to legalize her marriage without
a moment&rsquo;s delay.&nbsp; Heaven and earth were to be moved
at once to effect it.&nbsp; Day after day had passed; her union
had remained unsecured, and the idea of its nullity had gradually
ceased to be strange to her; till it became of little account
beside her bold resolve for the young man&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<h3>XXXVI</h3>
<p>The immediate effect upon St. Cleeve of the receipt of her
well-reasoned argument for retrocession was, naturally, a bitter
attack upon himself for having been guilty of such cruel
carelessness as to leave in her way the lawyer&rsquo;s letter
that had first made her aware of his uncle&rsquo;s provision for
him.&nbsp; Immature as he was, he could realize Viviette&rsquo;s
position sufficiently well to perceive what the poor lady must
suffer at having suddenly thrust upon her the responsibility of
repairing her own situation as a wife by ruining his as a
legatee.&nbsp; True, it was by the purest inadvertence that his
pending sacrifice of means had been discovered; but he should
have taken special pains to render such a mishap
impossible.&nbsp; If on the first occasion, when a revelation
might have been made with impunity, he would not put it in the
power of her good nature to relieve his position by refusing him,
he should have shown double care not to do so now, when she could
not exercise that benevolence without the loss of honour.</p>
<p>With a young man&rsquo;s inattention to issues he had not
considered how sharp her feelings as a woman must be in this
contingency.&nbsp; It had seemed the easiest thing in the world
to remedy the defect in their marriage, and therefore nothing to
be anxious about.&nbsp; And in his innocence of any thought of
appropriating the bequest by taking advantage of the loophole in
his matrimonial bond, he undervalued the importance of concealing
the existence of that bequest.</p>
<p>The looming fear of unhappiness between them revived in
Swithin the warm emotions of their earlier acquaintance.&nbsp;
Almost before the sun had set he hastened to Welland House in
search of her.&nbsp; The air was disturbed by stiff summer
blasts, productive of windfalls and premature descents of
leafage.&nbsp; It was an hour when unripe apples shower down in
orchards, and unbrowned chestnuts descend in their husks upon the
park glades.&nbsp; There was no help for it this afternoon but to
call upon her in a direct manner, regardless of suspicions.&nbsp;
He was thunderstruck when, while waiting in the full expectation
of being admitted to her presence, the answer brought back to him
was that she was unable to see him.</p>
<p>This had never happened before in the whole course of their
acquaintance.&nbsp; But he knew what it meant, and turned away
with a vague disquietude.&nbsp; He did not know that Lady
Constantine was just above his head, listening to his movements
with the liveliest emotions, and, while praying for him to go,
longing for him to insist on seeing her and spoil all.&nbsp; But
the faintest symptom being always sufficient to convince him of
having blundered, he unwittingly took her at her word, and went
rapidly away.</p>
<p>However, he called again the next day, and she, having gained
strength by one victory over herself, was enabled to repeat her
refusal with greater ease.&nbsp; Knowing this to be the only
course by which her point could be maintained, she clung to it
with strenuous and religious pertinacity.</p>
<p>Thus immured and self-controlling she passed a week.&nbsp; Her
brother, though he did not live in the house (preferring the
nearest watering-place at this time of the year), was continually
coming there; and one day he happened to be present when she
denied herself to Swithin for the third time.&nbsp; Louis, who
did not observe the tears in her eyes, was astonished and
delighted: she was coming to her senses at last.&nbsp; Believing
now that there had been nothing more between them than a
too-plainly shown partiality on her part, he expressed his
commendation of her conduct to her face.&nbsp; At this, instead
of owning to its advantage also, her tears burst forth
outright.</p>
<p>Not knowing what to make of this, Louis said&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I am simply upholding you in your
course.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, yes; I know it!&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;And
it is my deliberately chosen course.&nbsp; I wish
he&mdash;Swithin St. Cleeve&mdash;would go on his travels at
once, and leave the place!&nbsp; Six hundred a year has been left
him for travel and study of the southern constellations; and I
wish he would use it.&nbsp; You might represent the advantage to
him of the course if you cared to.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Louis thought he could do no better than let Swithin know this
as soon as possible.&nbsp; Accordingly when St. Cleeve was
writing in the hut the next day he heard the crackle of footsteps
over the fir-needles outside, and jumped up, supposing them to be
hers; but, to his disappointment, it was her brother who appeared
at the door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Excuse my invading the hermitage, St. Cleeve,&rsquo; he
said in his careless way, &lsquo;but I have heard from my sister
of your good fortune.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My good fortune?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, in having an opportunity for roving; and with a
traveller&rsquo;s conceit I couldn&rsquo;t help coming to give
you the benefit of my experience.&nbsp; When do you
start?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have not formed any plan as yet.&nbsp; Indeed, I had
not quite been thinking of going.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Louis stared.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not going?&nbsp; Then I may have been
misinformed.&nbsp; What I have heard is that a good uncle has
kindly bequeathed you a sufficient income to make a second Isaac
Newton of you, if you only use it as he directs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Swithin breathed quickly, but said nothing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you have not decided so to make use of it, let me
implore you, as your friend, and one nearly old enough to be your
father, to decide at once.&nbsp; Such a chance does not happen to
a scientific youth once in a century.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you for your good advice&mdash;for it is good in
itself, I know,&rsquo; said Swithin, in a low voice.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But has Lady Constantine spoken of it at all?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She thinks as I do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She has spoken to you on the subject?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly.&nbsp; More than that; it is at her
request&mdash;though I did not intend to say so&mdash;that I come
to speak to you about it now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Frankly and plainly,&rsquo; said Swithin, his voice
trembling with a compound of scientific and amatory emotion that
defies definition, &lsquo;does she say seriously that she wishes
me to go?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She does.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then go I will,&rsquo; replied Swithin firmly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I have been fortunate enough to interest some leading
astronomers, including the Astronomer Royal; and in a letter
received this morning I learn that the use of the Cape
Observatory has been offered me for any southern observations I
may wish to make.&nbsp; This offer I will accept.&nbsp; Will you
kindly let Lady Constantine know this, since she is interested in
my welfare?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Louis promised, and when he was gone Swithin looked blankly at
his own situation, as if he could scarcely believe in its
reality.&nbsp; Her letter to him, then, had been deliberately
written; she meant him to go.</p>
<p>But he was determined that none of those misunderstandings
which ruin the happiness of lovers should be allowed to operate
in the present case.&nbsp; He would see her, if he slept under
her walls all night to do it, and would hear the order to depart
from her own lips.&nbsp; This unexpected stand she was making for
his interests was winning his admiration to such a degree as to
be in danger of defeating the very cause it was meant to
subserve.&nbsp; A woman like this was not to be forsaken in a
hurry.&nbsp; He wrote two lines, and left the note at the house
with his own hand.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span
class="smcap">The Cabin</span>, <span
class="smcap">Rings-Hill</span>,<br />
<i>July</i> 7<i>th</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dearest Viviette</span>,&mdash;If
you insist, I will go.&nbsp; But letter-writing will not
do.&nbsp; I must have the command from your own two lips,
otherwise I shall not stir.&nbsp; I am here every evening at
seven.&nbsp; Can you come?&mdash;S.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This note, as fate would have it, reached her hands in the
single hour of that week when she was in a mood to comply with
his request, just when moved by a reactionary emotion after
dismissing Swithin.&nbsp; She went upstairs to the window that
had so long served purposes of this kind, and signalled
&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>St. Cleeve soon saw the answer she had given and watched her
approach from the tower as the sunset drew on.&nbsp; The vivid
circumstances of his life at this date led him ever to remember
the external scenes in which they were set.&nbsp; It was an
evening of exceptional irradiations, and the west heaven gleamed
like a foundry of all metals common and rare.&nbsp; The clouds
were broken into a thousand fragments, and the margin of every
fragment shone.&nbsp; Foreseeing the disadvantage and pain to her
of maintaining a resolve under the pressure of a meeting, he
vowed not to urge her by word or sign; to put the question
plainly and calmly, and to discuss it on a reasonable basis only,
like the philosophers they assumed themselves to be.</p>
<p>But this intention was scarcely adhered to in all its
integrity.&nbsp; She duly appeared on the edge of the field,
flooded with the metallic radiance that marked the close of this
day; whereupon he quickly descended the steps, and met her at the
cabin door.&nbsp; They entered it together.</p>
<p>As the evening grew darker and darker he listened to her
reasoning, which was precisely a repetition of that already sent
him by letter, and by degrees accepted her decision, since she
would not revoke it.&nbsp; Time came for them to say good-bye,
and then&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;He turn&rsquo;d and saw the terror in her
eyes,<br />
That yearn&rsquo;d upon him, shining in such wise<br />
As a star midway in the midnight fix&rsquo;d.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was the misery of her own condition that showed forth,
hitherto obscured by her ardour for ameliorating his.&nbsp; They
closed together, and kissed each other as though the emotion of
their whole year-and-half&rsquo;s acquaintance had settled down
upon that moment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I won&rsquo;t go away from you!&rsquo; said Swithin
huskily.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why did you propose it for an
instant?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thus the nearly ended interview was again prolonged, and
Viviette yielded to all the passion of her first union with
him.&nbsp; Time, however, was merciless, and the hour approached
midnight, and she was compelled to depart.&nbsp; Swithin walked
with her towards the house, as he had walked many times before,
believing that all was now smooth again between them, and caring,
it must be owned, very little for his fame as an expositor of the
southern constellations just then.</p>
<p>When they reached the silent house he said what he had not
ventured to say before, &lsquo;Fix the day&mdash;you have decided
that it is to be soon, and that I am not to go?&rsquo;</p>
<p>But youthful Swithin was far, very far, from being up to the
fond subtlety of Viviette this evening.&nbsp; &lsquo;I cannot
decide here,&rsquo; she said gently, releasing herself from his
arm; &lsquo;I will speak to you from the window.&nbsp; Wait for
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She vanished; and he waited.&nbsp; It was a long time before
the window opened, and he was not aware that, with her customary
complication of feeling, she had knelt for some time inside the
room before looking out.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well?&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It cannot be,&rsquo; she answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
cannot ruin you.&nbsp; But the day after you are five-and-twenty
our marriage shall be confirmed, if you choose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, my Viviette, how is this!&rsquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Swithin, I have not altered.&nbsp; But I feared for my
powers, and could not tell you whilst I stood by your side.&nbsp;
I ought not to have given way as I did to-night.&nbsp; Take the
bequest, and go.&nbsp; You are too young&mdash;to be
fettered&mdash;I should have thought of it!&nbsp; Do not
communicate with me for at least a year: it is imperative.&nbsp;
Do not tell me your plans.&nbsp; If we part, we do part.&nbsp; I
have vowed a vow not to further obstruct the course you had
decided on before you knew me and my puling ways; and by
Heaven&rsquo;s help I&rsquo;ll keep that vow. . . .&nbsp; Now
go.&nbsp; These are the parting words of your own
Viviette!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Swithin, who was stable as a giant in all that appertained to
nature and life outside humanity, was a mere pupil in domestic
matters.&nbsp; He was quite awed by her firmness, and looked
vacantly at her for a time, till she closed the window.&nbsp;
Then he mechanically turned, and went, as she had commanded.</p>
<h3>XXXVII</h3>
<p>A week had passed away.&nbsp; It had been a time of cloudy
mental weather to Swithin and Viviette, but the only noteworthy
fact about it was that what had been planned to happen therein
had actually taken place.&nbsp; Swithin had gone from Welland,
and would shortly go from England.</p>
<p>She became aware of it by a note that he posted to her on his
way through Warborne.&nbsp; There was much evidence of haste in
the note, and something of reserve.&nbsp; The latter she could
not understand, but it might have been obvious enough if she had
considered.</p>
<p>On the morning of his departure he had sat on the edge of his
bed, the sunlight streaming through the early mist, the
house-martens scratching the back of the ceiling over his head as
they scrambled out from the roof for their day&rsquo;s
gnat-chasing, the thrushes cracking snails on the garden stones
outside with the noisiness of little smiths at work on little
anvils.&nbsp; The sun, in sending its rods of yellow fire into
his room, sent, as he suddenly thought, mental illumination with
it.&nbsp; For the first time, as he sat there, it had crossed his
mind that Viviette might have reasons for this separation which
he knew not of.&nbsp; There might be family
reasons&mdash;mysterious blood necessities which are said to rule
members of old musty-mansioned families, and are unknown to other
classes of society&mdash;and they may have been just now brought
before her by her brother Louis on the condition that they were
religiously concealed.</p>
<p>The idea that some family skeleton, like those he had read of
in memoirs, had been unearthed by Louis, and held before her
terrified understanding as a matter which rendered
Swithin&rsquo;s departure, and the neutralization of the
marriage, no less indispensable to them than it was an advantage
to himself, seemed a very plausible one to Swithin just
now.&nbsp; Viviette might have taken Louis into her confidence at
last, for the sake of his brotherly advice.&nbsp; Swithin knew
that of her own heart she would never wish to get rid of him; but
coerced by Louis, might she not have grown to entertain views of
its expediency?&nbsp; Events made such a supposition on St.
Cleeve&rsquo;s part as natural as it was inaccurate, and,
conjoined with his own excitement at the thought of seeing a new
heaven overhead, influenced him to write but the briefest and
most hurried final note to her, in which he fully obeyed her
sensitive request that he would omit all reference to his
plans.&nbsp; These at the last moment had been modified to fall
in with the winter expedition formerly mentioned, to observe the
Transit of Venus at a remote southern station.</p>
<p>The business being done, and himself fairly plunged into the
preliminaries of an important scientific pilgrimage, Swithin
acquired that lightness of heart which most young men feel in
forsaking old love for new adventure, no matter how charming may
be the girl they leave behind them.&nbsp; Moreover, in the
present case, the man was endowed with that schoolboy temperament
which does not see, or at least consider with much curiosity, the
effect of a given scheme upon others than himself.&nbsp; The
bearing upon Lady Constantine of what was an undoubted
predicament for any woman, was forgotten in his feeling that she
had done a very handsome and noble thing for him, and that he was
therefore bound in honour to make the most of it.</p>
<p>His going had resulted in anything but lightness of heart for
her.&nbsp; Her sad fancy could, indeed, indulge in dreams of her
yellow-haired laddie without that formerly besetting fear that
those dreams would prompt her to actions likely to distract and
weight him.&nbsp; She was wretched on her own account, relieved
on his.&nbsp; She no longer stood in the way of his advancement,
and that was enough.&nbsp; For herself she could live in
retirement, visit the wood, the old camp, the column, and, like
&OElig;none, think of the life they had led there&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Mournful &OElig;none, wandering forlorn<br
/>
Of Paris, once her playmate on the hills,&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="nind">leaving it entirely to his goodness whether he would come and
claim her in the future, or desert her for ever.</p>
<p>She was diverted for a time from these sad performances by a
letter which reached her from Bishop Helmsdale.&nbsp; To see his
handwriting again on an envelope, after thinking so anxiously of
making a father-confessor of him, started her out of her
equanimity.&nbsp; She speedily regained it, however, when she
read his note.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span
class="smcap">The Palace</span>, <span
class="smcap">Melchester</span>,<br />
<i>July</i> 30, 18--.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Lady
Constantine</span>,&mdash;I am shocked and grieved that, in the
strange dispensation of things here below, my offer of marriage
should have reached you almost simultaneously with the
intelligence that your widowhood had been of several months less
duration than you and I, and the world, had supposed.&nbsp; I can
quite understand that, viewed from any side, the news must have
shaken and disturbed you; and your unequivocal refusal to
entertain any thought of a new alliance at such a moment was, of
course, intelligible, natural, and praiseworthy.&nbsp; At present
I will say no more beyond expressing a hope that you will accept
my assurances that I was quite ignorant of the news at the hour
of writing, and a sincere desire that in due time, and as soon as
you have recovered your equanimity, I may be allowed to renew my
proposal.&mdash;I am, my dear Lady Constantine, yours ever
sincerely,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">C.
Melchester</span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She laid the letter aside, and thought no more about it,
beyond a momentary meditation on the errors into which people
fall in reasoning from actions to motives.&nbsp; Louis, who was
now again with her, became in due course acquainted with the
contents of the letter, and was satisfied with the promising
position in which matters seemingly stood all round.</p>
<p>Lady Constantine went her mournful ways as she had planned to
do, her chief resort being the familiar column, where she
experienced the unutterable melancholy of seeing two carpenters
dismantle the dome of its felt covering, detach its ribs, and
clear away the enclosure at the top till everything stood as it
had stood before Swithin had been known to the place.&nbsp; The
equatorial had already been packed in a box, to be in readiness
if he should send for it from abroad.&nbsp; The cabin, too, was
in course of demolition, such having been his directions,
acquiesced in by her, before he started.&nbsp; Yet she could not
bear the idea that these structures, so germane to the events of
their romance, should be removed as if removed for ever.&nbsp;
Going to the men she bade them store up the materials intact,
that they might be re-erected if desired.&nbsp; She had the
junctions of the timbers marked with figures, the boards
numbered, and the different sets of screws tied up in independent
papers for identification.&nbsp; She did not hear the remarks of
the workmen when she had gone, to the effect that the young man
would as soon think of buying a halter for himself as come back
and spy at the moon from Rings-Hill Speer, after seeing the
glories of other nations and the gold and jewels that were found
there, or she might have been more unhappy than she was.</p>
<p>On returning from one of these walks to the column a curious
circumstance occurred.&nbsp; It was evening, and she was coming
as usual down through the sighing plantation, choosing her way
between the ramparts of the camp towards the outlet giving upon
the field, when suddenly in a dusky vista among the fir-trunks
she saw, or thought she saw, a golden-haired, toddling
child.&nbsp; The child moved a step or two, and vanished behind a
tree.&nbsp; Lady Constantine, fearing it had lost its way, went
quickly to the spot, searched, and called aloud.&nbsp; But no
child could she perceive or hear anywhere around.&nbsp; She
returned to where she had stood when first beholding it, and
looked in the same direction, but nothing reappeared.&nbsp; The
only object at all resembling a little boy or girl was the upper
tuft of a bunch of fern, which had prematurely yellowed to about
the colour of a fair child&rsquo;s hair, and waved occasionally
in the breeze.&nbsp; This, however, did not sufficiently explain
the phenomenon, and she returned to make inquiries of the man
whom she had left at work, removing the last traces of
Swithin&rsquo;s cabin.&nbsp; But he had gone with her departure
and the approach of night.&nbsp; Feeling an indescribable dread
she retraced her steps, and hastened homeward doubting, yet half
believing, what she had seemed to see, and wondering if her
imagination had played her some trick.</p>
<p>The tranquil mournfulness of her night of solitude terminated
in a most unexpected manner.</p>
<p>The morning after the above-mentioned incident Lady
Constantine, after meditating a while, arose with a strange
personal conviction that bore curiously on the aforesaid
hallucination.&nbsp; She realized a condition of things that she
had never anticipated, and for a moment the discovery of her
state so overwhelmed her that she thought she must die
outright.&nbsp; In her terror she said she had sown the wind to
reap the whirlwind.&nbsp; Then the instinct of self-preservation
flamed up in her like a fire.&nbsp; Her altruism in subjecting
her self-love to benevolence, and letting Swithin go away from
her, was demolished by the new necessity, as if it had been a
gossamer web.</p>
<p>There was no resisting or evading the spontaneous plan of
action which matured in her mind in five minutes.&nbsp; Where was
Swithin? how could he be got at instantly?&mdash;that was her
ruling thought.&nbsp; She searched about the room for his last
short note, hoping, yet doubting, that its contents were more
explicit on his intended movements than the few meagre syllables
which alone she could call to mind.&nbsp; She could not find the
letter in her room, and came downstairs to Louis as pale as a
ghost.</p>
<p>He looked up at her, and with some concern said,
&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am searching everywhere for a letter&mdash;a note
from Mr. St. Cleeve&mdash;just a few words telling me when the
<i>Occidental</i> sails, that I think he goes in.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why do you want that unimportant document?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is of the utmost importance that I should know
whether he has actually sailed or not!&rsquo; said she in
agonized tones.&nbsp; &lsquo;Where <i>can</i> that letter
be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Louis knew where that letter was, for having seen it on her
desk he had, without reading it, torn it up and thrown it into
the waste-paper basket, thinking the less that remained to remind
her of the young philosopher the better.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I destroyed it,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Louis! why did you?&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;I
am going to follow him; I think it best to do so; and I want to
know if he is gone&mdash;and now the date is lost!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Going to run after St. Cleeve?&nbsp; Absurd!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I am!&rsquo; she said with vehement
firmness.&nbsp; &lsquo;I must see him; I want to speak to him as
soon as possible.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good Lord, Viviette!&nbsp; Are you mad?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O what was the date of that ship!&nbsp; But it cannot
be helped.&nbsp; I start at once for Southampton.&nbsp; I have
made up my mind to do it.&nbsp; He was going to his uncle&rsquo;s
solicitors in the North first; then he was coming back to
Southampton.&nbsp; He cannot have sailed yet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe he has sailed,&rsquo; muttered Louis
sullenly.</p>
<p>She did not wait to argue with him, but returned upstairs,
where she rang to tell Green to be ready with the pony to drive
her to Warborne station in a quarter of an hour.</p>
<h3>XXXVIII</h3>
<p>Viviette&rsquo;s determination to hamper Swithin no longer had
led her, as has been shown, to balk any weak impulse to entreat
his return, by forbidding him to furnish her with his foreign
address.&nbsp; His ready disposition, his fear that there might
be other reasons behind, made him obey her only too
literally.&nbsp; Thus, to her terror and dismay, she had placed a
gratuitous difficulty in the way of her present endeavour.</p>
<p>She was ready before Green, and urged on that factotum so
wildly as to leave him no time to change his corduroys and
&lsquo;skitty-boots&rsquo; in which he had been gardening; he
therefore turned himself into a coachman as far down as his waist
merely&mdash;clapping on his proper coat, hat, and waistcoat, and
wrapping a rug over his horticultural half below.&nbsp; In this
compromise he appeared at the door, mounted, and reins in
hand.</p>
<p>Seeing how sad and determined Viviette was, Louis pitied her
so far as to put nothing in the way of her starting, though he
forbore to help her.&nbsp; He thought her conduct sentimental
foolery, the outcome of mistaken pity and &lsquo;such a kind of
gain-giving as would trouble a woman;&rsquo; and he decided that
it would be better to let this mood burn itself out than to keep
it smouldering by obstruction.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you remember the date of his sailing?&rsquo; she
said finally, as the pony-carriage turned to drive off.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He sails on the 25th, that is, to-day.&nbsp; But it may
not be till late in the evening.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With this she started, and reached Warborne in time for the
up-train.&nbsp; How much longer than it really is a long journey
can seem to be, was fully learnt by the unhappy Viviette that
day.&nbsp; The changeful procession of country seats past which
she was dragged, the names and memories of their owners, had no
points of interest for her now.&nbsp; She reached Southampton
about midday, and drove straight to the docks.</p>
<p>On approaching the gates she was met by a crowd of people and
vehicles coming out&mdash;men, women, children, porters, police,
cabs, and carts.&nbsp; The Occidental had just sailed.</p>
<p>The adverse intelligence came upon her with such odds after
her morning&rsquo;s tension that she could scarcely crawl back to
the cab which had brought her.&nbsp; But this was not a time to
succumb.&nbsp; As she had no luggage she dismissed the man, and,
without any real consciousness of what she was doing, crept away
and sat down on a pile of merchandise.</p>
<p>After long thinking her case assumed a more hopeful
complexion.&nbsp; Much might probably be done towards
communicating with him in the time at her command.&nbsp; The
obvious step to this end, which she should have thought of
sooner, would be to go to his grandmother in Welland Bottom, and
there obtain his itinerary in detail&mdash;no doubt well known to
Mrs. Martin.&nbsp; There was no leisure for her to consider
longer if she would be home again that night; and returning to
the railway she waited on a seat without eating or drinking till
a train was ready to take her back.</p>
<p>By the time she again stood in Warborne the sun rested his
chin upon the meadows, and enveloped the distant outline of the
Rings-Hill column in his humid rays.&nbsp; Hiring an empty fly
that chanced to be at the station she was driven through the
little town onward to Welland, which she approached about eight
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; At her request the man set her down at the
entrance to the park, and when he was out of sight, instead of
pursuing her way to the House, she went along the high road in
the direction of Mrs. Martin&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Dusk was drawing on, and the bats were wheeling over the green
basin called Welland Bottom by the time she arrived; and had any
other errand instigated her call she would have postponed it till
the morrow.&nbsp; Nobody responded to her knock, but she could
hear footsteps going hither and thither upstairs, and dull noises
as of articles moved from their places.&nbsp; She knocked again
and again, and ultimately the door was opened by Hannah as
usual.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I could make nobody hear,&rsquo; said Lady Constantine,
who was so weary she could scarcely stand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am very sorry, my lady,&rsquo; said Hannah, slightly
awed on beholding her visitor.&nbsp; &lsquo;But we was a putting
poor Mr. Swithin&rsquo;s room to rights, now that he is, as a
woman may say, dead and buried to us; so we didn&rsquo;t hear
your ladyship.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll call Mrs. Martin at once.&nbsp;
She is up in the room that used to be his work-room.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here Hannah&rsquo;s voice implied moist eyes, and Lady
Constantine&rsquo;s instantly overflowed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I&rsquo;ll go up to her,&rsquo; said Viviette; and
almost in advance of Hannah she passed up the shrunken ash
stairs.</p>
<p>The ebbing light was not enough to reveal to Mrs.
Martin&rsquo;s aged gaze the personality of her visitor, till
Hannah explained.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll get a light, my lady,&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I would rather not.&nbsp; What are you doing, Mrs.
Martin?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, the poor misguided boy is gone&mdash;and
he&rsquo;s gone for good to me!&nbsp; I am a woman of over
four-score years, my Lady Constantine; my junketting days are
over, and whether &rsquo;tis feasting or whether &rsquo;tis
sorrowing in the land will soon be nothing to me.&nbsp; But his
life may be long and active, and for the sake of him I care for
what I shall never see, and wish to make pleasant what I shall
never enjoy.&nbsp; I am setting his room in order, as the place
will be his own freehold when I am gone, so that when he comes
back he may find all his poor jim-cracks and trangleys as he left
&rsquo;em, and not feel that I have betrayed his
trust.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Martin&rsquo;s voice revealed that she had burst into
such few tears as were left her, and then Hannah began crying
likewise; whereupon Lady Constantine, whose heart had been
bursting all day (and who, indeed, considering her coming
trouble, had reason enough for tears), broke into bitterer sobs
than either&mdash;sobs of absolute pain, that could no longer be
concealed.</p>
<p>Hannah was the first to discover that Lady Constantine was
weeping with them; and her feelings being probably the least
intense among the three she instantly controlled herself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Refrain yourself, my dear woman, refrain!&rsquo; she
said hastily to Mrs. Martin; &lsquo;don&rsquo;t ye see how it do
raft my lady?&rsquo;&nbsp; And turning to Viviette she whispered,
&lsquo;Her years be so great, your ladyship, that perhaps
ye&rsquo;ll excuse her for busting out afore ye?&nbsp; We know
when the mind is dim, my lady, there&rsquo;s not the manners
there should be; but decayed people can&rsquo;t help it, poor old
soul!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hannah, that will do now.&nbsp; Perhaps Lady
Constantine would like to speak to me alone,&rsquo; said Mrs.
Martin.&nbsp; And when Hannah had retreated Mrs. Martin
continued: &lsquo;Such a charge as she is, my lady, on account of
her great age!&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll pardon her biding here as if
she were one of the family.&nbsp; I put up with such things
because of her long service, and we know that years lead to
childishness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What are you doing?&nbsp; Can I help you?&rsquo;
Viviette asked, as Mrs. Martin, after speaking, turned to lift
some large article.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, &rsquo;tis only the skeleton of a telescope
that&rsquo;s got no works in his inside,&rsquo; said
Swithin&rsquo;s grandmother, seizing the huge pasteboard tube
that Swithin had made, and abandoned because he could get no
lenses to suit it.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am going to hang it up to these
hooks, and there it will bide till he comes again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lady Constantine took one end, and the tube was hung up
against the whitewashed wall by strings that the old woman had
tied round it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s all his equinoctial lines, and his topics
of Capricorn, and I don&rsquo;t know what besides,&rsquo; Mrs.
Martin continued, pointing to some charcoal scratches on the
wall.&nbsp; &lsquo;I shall never rub &rsquo;em out; no, though
&rsquo;tis such untidiness as I was never brought up to, I shall
never rub &rsquo;em out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where has Swithin gone to first?&rsquo; asked Viviette
anxiously.&nbsp; &lsquo;Where does he say you are to write to
him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nowhere yet, my lady.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s gone traipsing
all over Europe and America, and then to the South Pacific Ocean
about this Transit of Venus that&rsquo;s going to be done
there.&nbsp; He is to write to us first&mdash;God knows
when!&mdash;for he said that if we didn&rsquo;t hear from him for
six months we were not to be gallied at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At this intelligence, so much worse than she had expected,
Lady Constantine stood mute, sank down, and would have fallen to
the floor if there had not been a chair behind her.&nbsp;
Controlling herself by a strenuous effort, she disguised her
despair and asked vacantly: &lsquo;From America to the South
Pacific&mdash;Transit of Venus?&rsquo;&nbsp; (Swithin&rsquo;s
arrangement to accompany the expedition had been made at the last
moment, and therefore she had not as yet been informed.)</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, to a lone island, I believe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, a lone islant, my lady!&rsquo; echoed Hannah, who
had crept in and made herself one of the family again, in spite
of Mrs. Martin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is going to meet the English and American
astronomers there at the end of the year.&nbsp; After that he
will most likely go on to the Cape.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But before the end of the year&mdash;what places did he
tell you of visiting?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me collect myself; he is going to the observatory
of Cambridge, United States, to meet some gentlemen there, and
spy through the great refractor.&nbsp; Then there&rsquo;s the
observatory of Chicago; and I think he has a letter to make him
beknown to a gentleman in the observatory at Marseilles&mdash;and
he wants to go to Vienna&mdash;and Poulkowa, too, he means to
take in his way&mdash;there being great instruments and a lot of
astronomers at each place.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Does he take Europe or America first?&rsquo; she asked
faintly, for the account seemed hopeless.</p>
<p>Mrs. Martin could not tell till she had heard from
Swithin.&nbsp; It depended upon what he had decided to do on the
day of his leaving England.</p>
<p>Lady Constantine bade the old people good-bye, and dragged her
weary limbs homeward.&nbsp; The fatuousness of forethought had
seldom been evinced more ironically.&nbsp; Had she done nothing
to hinder him, he would have kept up an unreserved communication
with her, and all might have been well.</p>
<p>For that night she could undertake nothing further, and she
waited for the next day.&nbsp; Then at once she wrote two letters
to Swithin, directing one to Marseilles observatory, one to the
observatory of Cambridge, U.S., as being the only two spots on
the face of the globe at which they were likely to intercept
him.&nbsp; Each letter stated to him the urgent reasons which
existed for his return, and contained a passionately regretful
intimation that the annuity on which his hopes depended must of
necessity be sacrificed by the completion of their original
contract without delay.</p>
<p>But letter conveyance was too slow a process to satisfy
her.&nbsp; To send an epitome of her epistles by telegraph was,
after all, indispensable.&nbsp; Such an imploring sentence as she
desired to address to him it would be hazardous to despatch from
Warborne, and she took a dreary journey to a strange town on
purpose to send it from an office at which she was unknown.</p>
<p>There she handed in her message, addressing it to the port of
arrival of the Occidental, and again returned home.</p>
<p>She waited; and there being no return telegram, the inference
was that he had somehow missed hers.&nbsp; For an answer to
either of her letters she would have to wait long enough to allow
him time to reach one of the observatories&mdash;a tedious
while.</p>
<p>Then she considered the weakness, the stultifying nature of
her attempt at recall.</p>
<p>Events mocked her on all sides.&nbsp; By the favour of an
accident, and by her own immense exertions against her instincts,
Swithin had been restored to the rightful heritage that he had
nearly forfeited on her account.&nbsp; He had just started off to
utilize it; when she, without a moment&rsquo;s warning, was
asking him again to cast it away.&nbsp; She had set a certain
machinery in motion&mdash;to stop it before it had revolved
once.</p>
<p>A horrid apprehension possessed her.&nbsp; It had been easy
for Swithin to give up what he had never known the advantages of
keeping; but having once begun to enjoy his possession would he
give it up now?&nbsp; Could he be depended on for such
self-sacrifice?&nbsp; Before leaving, he would have done anything
at her request; but the <i>mollia tempora fandi</i> had now
passed.&nbsp; Suppose there arrived no reply from him for the
next three months; and that when his answer came he were to
inform her that, having now fully acquiesced in her original
decision, he found the life he was leading so profitable as to be
unable to abandon it, even to please her; that he was very sorry,
but having embarked on this course by her advice he meant to
adhere to it by his own.</p>
<p>There was, indeed, every probability that, moving about as he
was doing, and cautioned as he had been by her very self against
listening to her too readily, she would receive no reply of any
sort from him for three or perhaps four months.&nbsp; This would
be on the eve of the Transit; and what likelihood was there that
a young man, full of ardour for that spectacle, would forego it
at the last moment to return to a humdrum domesticity with a
woman who was no longer a novelty?</p>
<p>If she could only leave him to his career, and save her own
situation also!&nbsp; But at that moment the proposition seemed
as impossible as to construct a triangle of two straight
lines.</p>
<p>In her walk home, pervaded by these hopeless views, she passed
near the dark and deserted tower.&nbsp; Night in that solitary
place, which would have caused her some uneasiness in her years
of blitheness, had no terrors for her now.&nbsp; She went up the
winding path, and, the door being unlocked, felt her way to the
top.&nbsp; The open sky greeted her as in times previous to the
dome-and-equatorial period; but there was not a star to suggest
to her in which direction Swithin had gone.&nbsp; The absence of
the dome suggested a way out of her difficulties.&nbsp; A leap in
the dark, and all would be over.&nbsp; But she had not reached
that stage of action as yet, and the thought was dismissed as
quickly as it had come.</p>
<p>The new consideration which at present occupied her mind was
whether she could have the courage to leave Swithin to himself,
as in the original plan, and singly meet her impending trial,
despising the shame, till he should return at five-and-twenty and
claim her?&nbsp; Yet was this assumption of his return so very
safe?&nbsp; How altered things would be at that time!&nbsp; At
twenty-five he would still be young and handsome; she would be
three-and-thirty, fading to middle-age and homeliness, from a
junior&rsquo;s point of view.&nbsp; A fear sharp as a frost
settled down upon her, that in any such scheme as this she would
be building upon the sand.</p>
<p>She hardly knew how she reached home that night.&nbsp;
Entering by the lawn door she saw a red coal in the direction of
the arbour.&nbsp; Louis was smoking there, and he came
forward.</p>
<p>He had not seen her since the morning and was naturally
anxious about her.&nbsp; She blessed the chance which enveloped
her in night and lessened the weight of the encounter one half by
depriving him of vision.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you accomplish your object?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How was that?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He has sailed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A very good thing for both, I say.&nbsp; I believe you
would have married him, if you could have overtaken
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That would I!&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good God!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would marry a tinker for that matter; I have reasons
for being any man&rsquo;s wife,&rsquo; she said recklessly,
&lsquo;only I should prefer to drown myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Louis held his breath, and stood rigid at the meaning her
words conveyed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But Louis, you don&rsquo;t know all!&rsquo; cried
Viviette.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am not so bad as you think; mine has
been folly&mdash;not vice.&nbsp; I thought I had married
him&mdash;and then I found I had not; the marriage was
invalid&mdash;Sir Blount was alive!&nbsp; And now Swithin has
gone away, and will not come back for my calling!&nbsp; How can
he?&nbsp; His fortune is left him on condition that he forms no
legal tie.&nbsp; O will he&mdash;will he, come again?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never, if that&rsquo;s the position of affairs,&rsquo;
said Louis firmly, after a pause.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What then shall I do?&rsquo; said Viviette.</p>
<p>Louis escaped the formidable difficulty of replying by
pretending to continue his Havannah; and she, bowed down to dust
by what she had revealed, crept from him into the house.&nbsp;
Louis&rsquo;s cigar went out in his hand as he stood looking
intently at the ground.</p>
<h3>XXXIX</h3>
<p>Louis got up the next morning with an idea in his head.&nbsp;
He had dressed for a journey, and breakfasted hastily.</p>
<p>Before he had started Viviette came downstairs.&nbsp; Louis,
who was now greatly disturbed about her, went up to his sister
and took her hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Aux grands maux les grands remedes</i>,&rsquo; he said,
gravely.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have a plan.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have a dozen!&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; But what are they worth?&nbsp; And yet there
must&mdash;there <i>must</i> be a way!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Viviette,&rsquo; said Louis, &lsquo;promise that you
will wait till I come home to-night, before you do
anything.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her distracted eyes showed slight comprehension of his request
as she said &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>An hour after that time Louis entered the train at Warborne,
and was speedily crossing a country of ragged woodland, which,
though intruded on by the plough at places, remained largely
intact from prehistoric times, and still abounded with yews of
gigantic growth and oaks tufted with mistletoe.&nbsp; It was the
route to Melchester.</p>
<p>On setting foot in that city he took the cathedral spire as
his guide, the place being strange to him; and went on till he
reached the archway dividing Melchester sacred from Melchester
secular.&nbsp; Thence he threaded his course into the precincts
of the damp and venerable Close, level as a bowling-green, and
beloved of rooks, who from their elm perches on high threatened
any unwary gazer with the mishap of Tobit.&nbsp; At the corner of
this reposeful spot stood the episcopal palace.</p>
<p>Louis entered the gates, rang the bell, and looked
around.&nbsp; Here the trees and rooks seemed older, if possible,
than those in the Close behind him.&nbsp; Everything was
dignified, and he felt himself like Punchinello in the
king&rsquo;s chambers.&nbsp; Verily in the present case Glanville
was not a man to stick at trifles any more than his illustrious
prototype; and on the servant bringing a message that his
lordship would see him at once, Louis marched boldly in.</p>
<p>Through an old dark corridor, roofed with old dark beams, the
servant led the way to the heavily-moulded door of the
Bishop&rsquo;s room.&nbsp; Dr. Helmsdale was there, and welcomed
Louis with considerable stateliness.&nbsp; But his condescension
was tempered with a curious anxiety, and even with
nervousness.</p>
<p>He asked in pointed tones after the health of Lady
Constantine; if Louis had brought an answer to the letter he had
addressed to her a day or two earlier; and if the contents of the
letter, or of the previous one, were known to him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have brought no answer from her,&rsquo; said
Louis.&nbsp; &lsquo;But the contents of your letter have been
made known to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Since entering the building Louis had more than once felt some
hesitation, and it might now, with a favouring manner from his
entertainer, have operated to deter him from going further with
his intention.&nbsp; But the Bishop had personal weaknesses that
were fatal to sympathy for more than a moment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then I may speak in confidence to you as her nearest
relative,&rsquo; said the prelate, &lsquo;and explain that I am
now in a position with regard to Lady Constantine which, in view
of the important office I hold, I should not have cared to place
myself in unless I had felt quite sure of not being refused by
her.&nbsp; And hence it is a great grief, and some mortification
to me, that I was refused&mdash;owing, of course, to the fact
that I unwittingly risked making my proposal at the very moment
when she was under the influence of those strange tidings, and
therefore not herself, and scarcely able to judge what was best
for her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Bishop&rsquo;s words disclosed a mind whose sensitive fear
of danger to its own dignity hindered it from criticism
elsewhere.&nbsp; Things might have been worse for Louis&rsquo;s
Puck-like idea of mis-mating his Hermia with this Demetrius.</p>
<p>Throwing a strong colour of earnestness into his mien he
replied: &lsquo;Bishop, Viviette is my only sister; I am her only
brother and friend.&nbsp; I am alarmed for her health and state
of mind.&nbsp; Hence I have come to consult you on this very
matter that you have broached.&nbsp; I come absolutely without
her knowledge, and I hope unconventionality may be excused in me
on the score of my anxiety for her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly.&nbsp; I trust that the prospect opened up by
my proposal, combined with this other news, has not proved too
much for her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My sister is distracted and distressed, Bishop
Helmsdale.&nbsp; She wants comfort.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not distressed by my letter?&rsquo; said the Bishop,
turning red.&nbsp; &lsquo;Has it lowered me in her
estimation?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;On the contrary; while your disinterested offer was
uppermost in her mind she was a different woman.&nbsp; It is this
other matter that oppresses her.&nbsp; The result upon her of the
recent discovery with regard to the late Sir Blount Constantine
is peculiar.&nbsp; To say that he ill-used her in his lifetime is
to understate a truth.&nbsp; He has been dead now a considerable
period; but this revival of his memory operates as a sort of
terror upon her.&nbsp; Images of the manner of Sir Blount&rsquo;s
death are with her night and day, intensified by a hideous
picture of the supposed scene, which was cruelly sent her.&nbsp;
She dreads being alone.&nbsp; Nothing will restore my poor
Viviette to her former cheerfulness but a distraction&mdash;a
hope&mdash;a new prospect.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is precisely what acceptance of my offer would
afford.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Precisely,&rsquo; said Louis, with great respect.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But how to get her to avail herself of it, after once
refusing you, is the difficulty, and my earnest
problem.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then we are quite at one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are.&nbsp; And it is to promote our wishes that I am
come; since she will do nothing of herself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you can give me no hope of a reply to my second
communication?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;None whatever&mdash;by letter,&rsquo; said Louis.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Her impression plainly is that she cannot encourage your
lordship.&nbsp; Yet, in the face of all this reticence, the
secret is that she loves you warmly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can you indeed assure me of that?&nbsp; Indeed,
indeed!&rsquo; said the good Bishop musingly.&nbsp; &lsquo;Then I
must try to see her.&nbsp; I begin to feel&mdash;to feel
strongly&mdash;that a course which would seem premature and
unbecoming in other cases would be true and proper conduct in
this.&nbsp; Her unhappy dilemmas&mdash;her unwonted
position&mdash;yes, yes&mdash;I see it all!&nbsp; I can afford to
have some little misconstruction put upon my motives.&nbsp; I
will go and see her immediately.&nbsp; Her past has been a cruel
one; she wants sympathy; and with Heaven&rsquo;s help I&rsquo;ll
give it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think the remedy lies that way,&rsquo; said Louis
gently.&nbsp; &lsquo;Some words came from her one night which
seemed to show it.&nbsp; I was standing on the terrace: I heard
somebody sigh in the dark, and found that it was she.&nbsp; I
asked her what was the matter, and gently pressed her on this
subject of boldly and promptly contracting a new marriage as a
means of dispersing the horrors of the old.&nbsp; Her answer
implied that she would have no objection to do it, and to do it
at once, provided she could remain externally passive in the
matter, that she would tacitly yield, in fact, to pressure, but
would not meet solicitation half-way.&nbsp; Now, Bishop
Helmsdale, you see what has prompted me.&nbsp; On the one hand is
a dignitary of high position and integrity, to say no more, who
is anxious to save her from the gloom of her situation; on the
other is this sister, who will not make known to you her
willingness to be saved&mdash;partly from apathy, partly from a
fear that she may be thought forward in responding favourably at
so early a moment, partly also, perhaps, from a modest sense that
there would be some sacrifice on your part in allying yourself
with a woman of her secluded and sad experience.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, there is no sacrifice!&nbsp; Quite otherwise.&nbsp;
I care greatly for this alliance, Mr. Glanville.&nbsp; Your
sister is very dear to me.&nbsp; Moreover, the advantages her
mind would derive from the enlarged field of activity that the
position of a bishop&rsquo;s wife would afford, are
palpable.&nbsp; I am induced to think that an early settlement of
the question&mdash;an immediate coming to the point&mdash;which
might be called too early in the majority of cases, would be a
right and considerate tenderness here.&nbsp; My only dread is
that she should think an immediate following up of the subject
premature.&nbsp; And the risk of a rebuff a second time is one
which, as you must perceive, it would be highly unbecoming in me
to run.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think the risk would be small, if your lordship would
approach her frankly.&nbsp; Write she will not, I am assured; and
knowing that, and having her interest at heart, I was induced to
come to you and make this candid statement in reply to your
communication.&nbsp; Her late husband having been virtually dead
these four or five years, believed dead two years, and actually
dead nearly one, no reproach could attach to her if she were to
contract another union to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I agree with you, Mr. Glanville,&rsquo; said the Bishop
warmly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I will think this over.&nbsp; Her motive in
not replying I can quite understand: your motive in coming I can
also understand and appreciate in a brother.&nbsp; If I feel
convinced that it would be a seemly and expedient thing I will
come to Welland to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The point to which Louis had brought the Bishop being so
satisfactory, he feared to endanger it by another word.&nbsp; He
went away almost hurriedly, and at once left the precincts of the
cathedral, lest another encounter with Dr. Helmsdale should lead
the latter to take a new and slower view of his duties as
Viviette&rsquo;s suitor.</p>
<p>He reached Welland by dinner-time, and came upon Viviette in
the same pensive mood in which he had left her.&nbsp; It seemed
she had hardly moved since.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you discovered Swithin St. Cleeve&rsquo;s
address?&rsquo; she said, without looking up at him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Louis.</p>
<p>Then she broke out with indescribable anguish: &lsquo;But you
asked me to wait till this evening; and I have waited through the
long day, in the belief that your words meant something, and that
you would bring good tidings!&nbsp; And now I find your words
meant nothing, and you have <i>not</i> brought good
tidings!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Louis could not decide for a moment what to say to this.&nbsp;
Should he venture to give her thoughts a new course by a
revelation of his design?&nbsp; No: it would be better to prolong
her despair yet another night, and spring relief upon her
suddenly, that she might jump at it and commit herself without an
interval for reflection on certain aspects of the proceeding.</p>
<p>Nothing, accordingly, did he say; and conjecturing that she
would be hardly likely to take any desperate step that night, he
left her to herself.</p>
<p>His anxiety at this crisis continued to be great.&nbsp;
Everything depended on the result of the Bishop&rsquo;s
self-communion.&nbsp; Would he or would he not come the next
day?&nbsp; Perhaps instead of his important presence there would
appear a letter postponing the visit indefinitely.&nbsp; If so,
all would be lost.</p>
<p>Louis&rsquo;s suspense kept him awake, and he was not alone in
his sleeplessness.&nbsp; Through the night he heard his sister
walking up and down, in a state which betokened that for every
pang of grief she had disclosed, twice as many had remained
unspoken.&nbsp; He almost feared that she might seek to end her
existence by violence, so unreasonably sudden were her moods; and
he lay and longed for the day.</p>
<p>It was morning.&nbsp; She came down the same as usual, and
asked if there had arrived any telegram or letter; but there was
neither.&nbsp; Louis avoided her, knowing that nothing he could
say just then would do her any good.</p>
<p>No communication had reached him from the Bishop, and that
looked well.&nbsp; By one ruse and another, as the day went on,
he led her away from contemplating the remote possibility of
hearing from Swithin, and induced her to look at the worst
contingency as her probable fate.&nbsp; It seemed as if she
really made up her mind to this, for by the afternoon she was
apathetic, like a woman who neither hoped nor feared.</p>
<p>And then a fly drove up to the door.</p>
<p>Louis, who had been standing in the hall the greater part of
that day, glanced out through a private window, and went to
Viviette.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Bishop has called,&rsquo; he
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Be ready to see him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Bishop of Melchester?&rsquo; said Viviette,
bewildered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; I asked him to come.&nbsp; He comes for an
answer to his letters.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;An answer&mdash;to&mdash;his&mdash;letters?&rsquo; she
murmured.</p>
<p>&lsquo;An immediate reply of yes or no.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her face showed the workings of her mind.&nbsp; How entirely
an answer of assent, at once acted on for better or for worse,
would clear the spectre from her path, there needed no tongue to
tell.&nbsp; It would, moreover, accomplish that end without
involving the impoverishment of Swithin&mdash;the inevitable
result if she had adopted the legitimate road out of her
trouble.&nbsp; Hitherto there had seemed to her dismayed mind,
unenlightened as to any course save one of honesty, no possible
achievement of <i>both</i> her desires&mdash;the saving of
Swithin and the saving of herself.&nbsp; But behold, here was a
way!&nbsp; A tempter had shown it to her.&nbsp; It involved a
great wrong, which to her had quite obscured its
feasibility.&nbsp; But she perceived now that it was indeed a
way.&nbsp; Nature was forcing her hand at this game; and to what
will not nature compel her weaker victims, in extremes?</p>
<p>Louis left her to think it out.&nbsp; When he reached the
drawing-room Dr. Helmsdale was standing there with the air of a
man too good for his destiny&mdash;which, to be just to him, was
not far from the truth this time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you broken my message to her?&rsquo; asked the
Bishop sonorously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not your message; your visit,&rsquo; said Louis.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I leave the rest in your Lordship&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; I
have done all I can for her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She was in her own small room to-day; and, feeling that it
must be a bold stroke or none, he led the Bishop across the hall
till he reached her apartment and opened the door; but instead of
following he shut it behind his visitor.</p>
<p>Then Glanville passed an anxious time.&nbsp; He walked from
the foot of the staircase to the star of old swords and pikes on
the wall; from these to the stags&rsquo; horns; thence down the
corridor as far as the door, where he could hear murmuring
inside, but not its import.&nbsp; The longer they remained
closeted the more excited did he become.&nbsp; That she had not
peremptorily negatived the proposal at the outset was a strong
sign of its success.&nbsp; It showed that she had admitted
argument; and the worthy Bishop had a pleader on his side whom he
knew little of.&nbsp; The very weather seemed to favour Dr.
Helmsdale in his suit.&nbsp; A blusterous wind had blown up from
the west, howling in the smokeless chimneys, and suggesting to
the feminine mind storms at sea, a tossing ocean, and the
hopeless inaccessibility of all astronomers and men on the other
side of the same.</p>
<p>The Bishop had entered Viviette&rsquo;s room at ten minutes
past three.&nbsp; The long hand of the hall clock lay level at
forty-five minutes past when the knob of the door moved, and he
came out.&nbsp; Louis met him where the passage joined the
hall.</p>
<p>Dr. Helmsdale was decidedly in an emotional state, his face
being slightly flushed.&nbsp; Louis looked his anxious inquiry
without speaking it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She accepts me,&rsquo; said the Bishop in a low
voice.&nbsp; &lsquo;And the wedding is to be soon.&nbsp; Her long
solitude and sufferings justify haste.&nbsp; What you said was
true.&nbsp; Sheer weariness and distraction have driven her to
me.&nbsp; She was quite passive at last, and agreed to anything I
proposed&mdash;such is the persuasive force of trained logical
reasoning!&nbsp; A good and wise woman, she perceived what a true
shelter from sadness was offered in me, and was not the one to
despise Heaven&rsquo;s gift.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>XL</h3>
<p>The silence of Swithin was to be accounted for by the
circumstance that neither to the Mediterranean nor to America had
he in the first place directed his steps.&nbsp; Feeling himself
absolutely free he had, on arriving at Southampton, decided to
make straight for the Cape, and hence had not gone aboard the
Occidental at all.&nbsp; His object was to leave his heavier
luggage there, examine the capabilities of the spot for his
purpose, find out the necessity or otherwise of shipping over his
own equatorial, and then cross to America as soon as there was a
good opportunity.&nbsp; Here he might inquire the movements of
the Transit expedition to the South Pacific, and join it at such
a point as might be convenient.</p>
<p>Thus, though wrong in her premisses, Viviette had intuitively
decided with sad precision.&nbsp; There was, as a matter of fact,
a great possibility of her not being able to communicate with him
for several months, notwithstanding that he might possibly
communicate with her.</p>
<p>This excursive time was an awakening for Swithin.&nbsp; To
altered circumstances inevitably followed altered views.&nbsp;
That such changes should have a marked effect upon a young man
who had made neither grand tour nor petty one&mdash;who had, in
short, scarcely been away from home in his life&mdash;was nothing
more than natural.&nbsp; New ideas struggled to disclose
themselves and with the addition of strange twinklers to his
southern horizon came an absorbed attention that way, and a
corresponding forgetfulness of what lay to the north behind his
back, whether human or celestial.&nbsp; Whoever may deplore it
few will wonder that Viviette, who till then had stood high in
his heaven, if she had not dominated it, sank, like the North
Star, lower and lower with his retreat southward.&nbsp; Master of
a large advance of his first year&rsquo;s income in circular
notes, he perhaps too readily forgot that the mere act of honour,
but for her self-suppression, would have rendered him
penniless.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, to come back and claim her at the specified time,
four years thence, if she should not object to be claimed, was as
much a part of his programme as were the exploits abroad and
elsewhere that were to prelude it.&nbsp; The very thoroughness of
his intention for that advanced date inclined him all the more
readily to shelve the subject now.&nbsp; Her unhappy caution to
him not to write too soon was a comfortable license in his
present state of tension about sublime scientific things, which
knew not woman, nor her sacrifices, nor her fears.&nbsp; In truth
he was not only too young in years, but too literal, direct, and
uncompromising in nature to understand such a woman as Lady
Constantine; and she suffered for that limitation in him as it
had been antecedently probable that she would do.</p>
<p>He stayed but a little time at Cape Town on this his first
reconnoitring journey; and on that account wrote to no one from
the place.&nbsp; On leaving he found there remained some weeks on
his hands before he wished to cross to America; and feeling an
irrepressible desire for further studies in navigation on
shipboard, and under clear skies, he took the steamer for
Melbourne; returning thence in due time, and pursuing his journey
to America, where he landed at Boston.</p>
<p>Having at last had enough of great circles and other nautical
reckonings, and taking no interest in men or cities, this
indefatigable scrutineer of the universe went immediately on to
Cambridge; and there, by the help of an introduction he had
brought from England, he revelled for a time in the glories of
the gigantic refractor (which he was permitted to use on
occasion), and in the pleasures of intercourse with the
scientific group around.&nbsp; This brought him on to the time of
starting with the Transit expedition, when he and his kind became
lost to the eye of civilization behind the horizon of the Pacific
Ocean.</p>
<p>To speak of their doings on this pilgrimage, of ingress and
egress, of tangent and parallax, of external and internal
contact, would avail nothing.&nbsp; Is it not all written in the
chronicles of the Astronomical Society?&nbsp; More to the point
will it be to mention that Viviette&rsquo;s letter to Cambridge
had been returned long before he reached that place, while her
missive to Marseilles was, of course, misdirected
altogether.&nbsp; On arriving in America, uncertain of an address
in that country at which he would stay long, Swithin wrote his
first letter to his grandmother; and in this he ordered that all
communications should be sent to await him at Cape Town, as the
only safe spot for finding him, sooner or later.&nbsp; The
equatorial he also directed to be forwarded to the same
place.&nbsp; At this time, too, he ventured to break
Viviette&rsquo;s commands, and address a letter to her, not
knowing of the strange results that had followed his absence from
home.</p>
<p>It was February.&nbsp; The Transit was over, the scientific
company had broken up, and Swithin had steamed towards the Cape
to take up his permanent abode there, with a view to his great
task of surveying, charting and theorizing on those exceptional
features in the southern skies which had been but partially
treated by the younger Herschel.&nbsp; Having entered Table Bay
and landed on the quay, he called at once at the post-office.</p>
<p>Two letters were handed him, and he found from the date that
they had been waiting there for some time.&nbsp; One of these
epistles, which had a weather-worn look as regarded the ink, and
was in old-fashioned penmanship, he knew to be from his
grandmother.&nbsp; He opened it before he had as much as glanced
at the superscription of the second.</p>
<p>Besides immaterial portions, it contained the
following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;J reckon you know by now of our main news
this fall, but lest you should not have heard of it J send the
exact thing snipped out of the newspaper.&nbsp; Nobody expected
her to do it quite so soon; but it is said hereabout that my lord
bishop and my lady had been drawing nigh to an understanding
before the glum tidings of Sir Blount&rsquo;s taking of his own
life reached her; and the account of this wicked deed was so sore
afflicting to her mind, and made her poor heart so timid and low,
that in charity to my lady her few friends agreed on urging her
to let the bishop go on paying his court as before,
notwithstanding she had not been a widow-woman near so long as
was thought.&nbsp; This, as it turned out, she was willing to do;
and when my lord asked her she told him she would marry him at
once or never.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s as J was told, and J had it
from those that know.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cutting from the newspaper was an ordinary announcement of
marriage between the Bishop of Melchester and Lady
Constantine.</p>
<p>Swithin was so astounded at the intelligence of what for the
nonce seemed Viviette&rsquo;s wanton fickleness that he quite
omitted to look at the second letter; and remembered nothing
about it till an hour afterwards, when sitting in his own room at
the hotel.</p>
<p>It was in her handwriting, but so altered that its
superscription had not arrested his eye.&nbsp; It had no
beginning, or date; but its contents soon acquainted him with her
motive for the precipitate act.&nbsp; The few concluding
sentences are all that it will be necessary to quote
here:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;There was no way out of it, even if I could
have found you, without infringing one of the conditions I had
previously laid down.&nbsp; The long desire of my heart has been
not to impoverish you or mar your career.&nbsp; The new desire
was to save myself and, still more, another yet unborn. . .
.&nbsp; I have done a desperate thing.&nbsp; Yet for myself I
could do no better, and for you no less.&nbsp; I would have
sacrificed my single self to honesty, but I was not alone
concerned.&nbsp; What woman has a right to blight a coming life
to preserve her personal integrity? . . .&nbsp; The one bright
spot is that it saves you and your endowment from further
catastrophes, and preserves you to the pleasant paths of
scientific fame.&nbsp; I no longer lie like a log across your
path, which is now as open as on the day before you saw me, and
ere I encouraged you to win me.&nbsp; Alas, Swithin, I ought to
have known better.&nbsp; The folly was great, and the suffering
be upon my head!&nbsp; I ought not to have consented to that last
interview: all was well till then! . . .&nbsp; Well, I have borne
much, and am not unprepared.&nbsp; As for you, Swithin, by simply
pressing straight on your triumph is assured.&nbsp; Do not
communicate with me in any way&mdash;not even in answer to
this.&nbsp; Do not think of me.&nbsp; Do not see me ever any
more.&mdash;Your unhappy</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span
class="smcap">Viviette</span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Swithin&rsquo;s heart swelled within him in sudden pity for
her, first; then he blanched with a horrified sense of what she
had done, and at his own relation to the deed.&nbsp; He felt like
an awakened somnambulist who should find that he had been
accessory to a tragedy during his unconsciousness.&nbsp; She had
loosened the knot of her difficulties by cutting it
unscrupulously through and through.</p>
<p>The big tidings rather dazed than crushed him, his predominant
feeling being soon again one of keenest sorrow and
sympathy.&nbsp; Yet one thing was obvious; he could do
nothing&mdash;absolutely nothing.&nbsp; The event which he now
heard of for the first time had taken place five long months
ago.&nbsp; He reflected, and regretted&mdash;and mechanically
went on with his preparations for settling down to work under the
shadow of Table Mountain.&nbsp; He was as one who suddenly finds
the world a stranger place than he thought; but is excluded by
age, temperament, and situation from being much more than an
astonished spectator of its strangeness.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The Royal Observatory was about a mile out of the town, and
hither he repaired as soon as he had established himself in
lodgings.&nbsp; He had decided, on his first visit to the Cape,
that it would be highly advantageous to him if he could
supplement the occasional use of the large instruments here by
the use at his own house of his own equatorial, and had
accordingly given directions that it might be sent over from
England.&nbsp; The precious possession now arrived; and although
the sight of it&mdash;of the brasses on which her hand had often
rested, of the eyepiece through which her dark eyes had
beamed&mdash;engendered some decidedly bitter regrets in him for
a time, he could not long afford to give to the past the days
that were meant for the future.</p>
<p>Unable to get a room convenient for a private observatory he
resolved at last to fix the instrument on a solid pillar in the
garden; and several days were spent in accommodating it to its
new position.&nbsp; In this latitude there was no necessity for
economizing clear nights as he had been obliged to do on the old
tower at Welland.&nbsp; There it had happened more than once,
that after waiting idle through days and nights of cloudy
weather, Viviette would fix her time for meeting him at an hour
when at last he had an opportunity of seeing the sky; so that in
giving to her the golden moments of cloudlessness he was losing
his chance with the orbs above.</p>
<p>Those features which usually attract the eye of the visitor to
a new latitude are the novel forms of human and vegetable life,
and other such sublunary things.&nbsp; But the young man glanced
slightingly at these; the changes overhead had all his
attention.&nbsp; The old subject was imprinted there, but in a
new type.&nbsp; Here was a heaven, fixed and ancient as the
northern; yet it had never appeared above the Welland hills since
they were heaved up from beneath.&nbsp; Here was an unalterable
circumpolar region; but the polar patterns stereotyped in history
and legend&mdash;without which it had almost seemed that a polar
sky could not exist&mdash;had never been seen therein.</p>
<p>St. Cleeve, as was natural, began by cursory surveys, which
were not likely to be of much utility to the world or to
himself.&nbsp; He wasted several weeks&mdash;indeed above two
months&mdash;in a comparatively idle survey of southern
novelties; in the mere luxury of looking at stellar objects whose
wonders were known, recounted, and classified, long before his
own personality had been heard of.&nbsp; With a child&rsquo;s
simple delight he allowed his instrument to rove, evening after
evening, from the gorgeous glitter of Canopus to the hazy clouds
of Magellan.&nbsp; Before he had well finished this optical
prelude there floated over to him from the other side of the
Equator the postscript to the epistle of his lost Viviette.&nbsp;
It came in the vehicle of a common newspaper, under the head of
&lsquo;Births:&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;April 10th, 18--, at the Palace, Melchester, the wife
of the Bishop of Melchester, of a son.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>XLI</h3>
<p>Three years passed away, and Swithin still remained at the
Cape, quietly pursuing the work that had brought him there.&nbsp;
His memoranda of observations had accumulated to a wheelbarrow
load, and he was beginning to shape them into a treatise which
should possess some scientific utility.</p>
<p>He had gauged the southern skies with greater results than
even he himself had anticipated.&nbsp; Those unfamiliar
constellations which, to the casual beholder, are at most a new
arrangement of ordinary points of light, were to this professed
astronomer, as to his brethren, a far greater matter.</p>
<p>It was below the surface that his material lay.&nbsp; There,
in regions revealed only to the instrumental observer, were suns
of hybrid kind&mdash;fire-fogs, floating nuclei, globes that flew
in groups like swarms of bees, and other extraordinary
sights&mdash;which, when decomposed by Swithin&rsquo;s
equatorial, turned out to be the beginning of a new series of
phenomena instead of the end of an old one.</p>
<p>There were gloomy deserts in those southern skies such as the
north shows scarcely an example of; sites set apart for the
position of suns which for some unfathomable reason were left
uncreated, their places remaining ever since conspicuous by their
emptiness.</p>
<p>The inspection of these chasms brought him a second pulsation
of that old horror which he had used to describe to Viviette as
produced in him by bottomlessness in the north heaven.&nbsp; The
ghostly finger of limitless vacancy touched him now on the other
side.&nbsp; Infinite deeps in the north stellar region had a
homely familiarity about them, when compared with infinite deeps
in the region of the south pole.&nbsp; This was an even more
unknown tract of the unknown.&nbsp; Space here, being less the
historic haunt of human thought than overhead at home, seemed to
be pervaded with a more lonely loneliness.</p>
<p>Were there given on paper to these astronomical exercitations
of St. Cleeve a space proportionable to that occupied by his year
with Viviette at Welland, this narrative would treble its length;
but not a single additional glimpse would be afforded of Swithin
in his relations with old emotions.&nbsp; In these experiments
with tubes and glasses, important as they were to human
intellect, there was little food for the sympathetic instincts
which create the changes in a life.&nbsp; That which is the
foreground and measuring base of one perspective draught may be
the vanishing-point of another perspective draught, while yet
they are both draughts of the same thing.&nbsp; Swithin&rsquo;s
doings and discoveries in the southern sidereal system were, no
doubt, incidents of the highest importance to him; and yet from
an intersocial point of view they served but the humble purpose
of killing time, while other doings, more nearly allied to his
heart than to his understanding, developed themselves at
home.</p>
<p>In the intervals between his professional occupations he took
walks over the sand-flats near, or among the farms which were
gradually overspreading the country in the vicinity of Cape
Town.&nbsp; He grew familiar with the outline of Table Mountain,
and the fleecy &lsquo;Devil&rsquo;s Table-Cloth&rsquo; which used
to settle on its top when the wind was south-east.&nbsp; On these
promenades he would more particularly think of Viviette, and of
that curious pathetic chapter in his life with her which seemed
to have wound itself up and ended for ever.&nbsp; Those scenes
were rapidly receding into distance, and the intensity of his
sentiment regarding them had proportionately abated.&nbsp; He
felt that there had been something wrong therein, and yet he
could not exactly define the boundary of the wrong.&nbsp;
Viviette&rsquo;s sad and amazing sequel to that chapter had still
a fearful, catastrophic aspect in his eyes; but instead of musing
over it and its bearings he shunned the subject, as we shun by
night the shady scene of a disaster, and keep to the open
road.</p>
<p>He sometimes contemplated her apart from the
past&mdash;leading her life in the Cathedral Close at Melchester;
and wondered how often she looked south and thought of where he
was.</p>
<p>On one of these afternoon walks in the neighbourhood of the
Royal Observatory he turned and gazed towards the signal-post on
the Lion&rsquo;s Rump.&nbsp; This was a high promontory to the
north-west of Table Mountain, and overlooked Table Bay.&nbsp;
Before his eyes had left the scene the signal was suddenly
hoisted on the staff.&nbsp; It announced that a mail steamer had
appeared in view over the sea.&nbsp; In the course of an hour he
retraced his steps, as he had often done on such occasions, and
strolled leisurely across the intervening mile and a half till he
arrived at the post-office door.</p>
<p>There was no letter from England for him; but there was a
newspaper, addressed in the seventeenth century handwriting of
his grandmother, who, in spite of her great age, still retained a
steady hold on life.&nbsp; He turned away disappointed, and
resumed his walk into the country, opening the paper as he went
along.</p>
<p>A cross in black ink attracted his attention; and it was
opposite a name among the &lsquo;Deaths.&rsquo;&nbsp; His blood
ran icily as he discerned the words &lsquo;The Palace,
Melchester.&rsquo;&nbsp; But it was not she.&nbsp; Her husband,
the Bishop of Melchester, had, after a short illness, departed
this life at the comparatively early age of fifty years.</p>
<p>All the enactments of the bygone days at Welland now started
up like an awakened army from the ground.&nbsp; But a few months
were wanting to the time when he would be of an age to marry
without sacrificing the annuity which formed his means of
subsistence.&nbsp; It was a point in his life that had had no
meaning or interest for him since his separation from Viviette,
for women were now no more to him than the inhabitants of
Jupiter.&nbsp; But the whirligig of time having again set
Viviette free, the aspect of home altered, and conjecture as to
her future found room to work anew.</p>
<p>But beyond the simple fact that she was a widow he for some
time gained not an atom of intelligence concerning her.&nbsp;
There was no one of whom he could inquire but his grandmother,
and she could tell him nothing about a lady who dwelt far away at
Melchester.</p>
<p>Several months slipped by thus; and no feeling within him rose
to sufficient strength to force him out of a passive
attitude.&nbsp; Then by the merest chance his granny stated in
one of her rambling epistles that Lady Constantine was coming to
live again at Welland in the old house, with her child, now a
little boy between three and four years of age.</p>
<p>Swithin, however, lived on as before.</p>
<p>But by the following autumn a change became necessary for the
young man himself.&nbsp; His work at the Cape was done.&nbsp; His
uncle&rsquo;s wishes that he should study there had been more
than observed.&nbsp; The materials for his great treatise were
collected, and it now only remained for him to arrange, digest,
and publish them, for which purpose a return to England was
indispensable.</p>
<p>So the equatorial was unscrewed, and the stand taken down; the
astronomer&rsquo;s barrow-load of precious memoranda, and rolls
upon rolls of diagrams, representing three years of continuous
labour, were safely packed; and Swithin departed for good and all
from the shores of Cape Town.</p>
<p>He had long before informed his grandmother of the date at
which she might expect him; and in a reply from her, which
reached him just previous to sailing, she casually mentioned that
she frequently saw Lady Constantine; that on the last occasion
her ladyship had shown great interest in the information that
Swithin was coming home, and had inquired the time of his
return.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>On a late summer day Swithin stepped from the train at
Warborne, and, directing his baggage to be sent on after him, set
out on foot for old Welland once again.</p>
<p>It seemed but the day after his departure, so little had the
scene changed.&nbsp; True, there was that change which is always
the first to arrest attention in places that are conventionally
called unchanging&mdash;a higher and broader vegetation at every
familiar corner than at the former time.</p>
<p>He had not gone a mile when he saw walking before him a
clergyman whose form, after consideration, he recognized, in
spite of a novel whiteness in that part of his hair that showed
below the brim of his hat.&nbsp; Swithin walked much faster than
this gentleman, and soon was at his side.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Torkingham!&nbsp; I knew it was,&rsquo; said
Swithin.</p>
<p>Mr. Torkingham was slower in recognizing the astronomer, but
in a moment had greeted him with a warm shake of the hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have been to the station on purpose to meet
you!&rsquo; cried Mr. Torkingham, &lsquo;and was returning with
the idea that you had not come.&nbsp; I am your
grandmother&rsquo;s emissary.&nbsp; She could not come herself,
and as she was anxious, and nobody else could be spared, I came
for her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then they walked on together.&nbsp; The parson told Swithin
all about his grandmother, the parish, and his endeavours to
enlighten it; and in due course said, &lsquo;You are no doubt
aware that Lady Constantine is living again at
Welland?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Swithin said he had heard as much, and added, what was far
within the truth, that the news of the Bishop&rsquo;s death had
been a great surprise to him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Mr. Torkingham, with nine thoughts to
one word.&nbsp; &lsquo;One might have prophesied, to look at him,
that Melchester would not lack a bishop for the next forty
years.&nbsp; Yes; pale death knocks at the cottages of the poor
and the palaces of kings with an impartial foot!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was he a particularly good man?&rsquo; asked
Swithin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He was not a Ken or a Heber.&nbsp; To speak candidly,
he had his faults, of which arrogance was not the least.&nbsp;
But who is perfect?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Swithin, somehow, felt relieved to hear that the Bishop was
not a perfect man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;His poor wife, I fear, had not a great deal more
happiness with him than with her first husband.&nbsp; But one
might almost have foreseen it; the marriage was hasty&mdash;the
result of a red-hot caprice, hardly becoming in a man of his
position; and it betokened a want of temperate discretion which
soon showed itself in other ways.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all there
was to be said against him, and now it&rsquo;s all over, and
things have settled again into their old course.&nbsp; But the
Bishop&rsquo;s widow is not the Lady Constantine of former
days.&nbsp; No; put it as you will, she is not the same.&nbsp;
There seems to be a nameless something on her mind&mdash;a
trouble&mdash;a rooted melancholy, which no man&rsquo;s ministry
can reach.&nbsp; Formerly she was a woman whose confidence it was
easy to gain; but neither religion nor philosophy avails with her
now.&nbsp; Beyond that, her life is strangely like what it was
when you were with us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Conversing thus they pursued the turnpike road till their
conversation was interrupted by a crying voice on their
left.&nbsp; They looked, and perceived that a child, in getting
over an adjoining stile, had fallen on his face.</p>
<p>Mr. Torkingham and Swithin both hastened up to help the
sufferer, who was a lovely little fellow with flaxen hair, which
spread out in a frill of curls from beneath a quaint,
close-fitting velvet cap that he wore.&nbsp; Swithin picked him
up, while Mr. Torkingham wiped the sand from his lips and nose,
and administered a few words of consolation, together with a few
sweet-meats, which, somewhat to Swithin&rsquo;s surprise, the
parson produced as if by magic from his pocket.&nbsp; One half
the comfort rendered would have sufficed to soothe such a
disposition as the child&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He ceased crying and ran
away in delight to his unconscious nurse, who was reaching up for
blackberries at a hedge some way off.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know who he is, of course?&rsquo; said Mr.
Torkingham, as they resumed their journey.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Swithin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I thought you did.&nbsp; Yet how should you?&nbsp;
It is Lady Constantine&rsquo;s boy&mdash;her only child.&nbsp;
His fond mother little thinks he is so far away from
home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear me!&mdash;Lady Constantine&rsquo;s&mdash;ah, how
interesting!&rsquo;&nbsp; Swithin paused abstractedly for a
moment, then stepped back again to the stile, while he stood
watching the little boy out of sight.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can never venture out of doors now without sweets in
my pocket,&rsquo; continued the good-natured vicar: &lsquo;and
the result is that I meet that young man more frequently on my
rounds than any other of my parishioners.&rsquo;</p>
<p>St. Cleeve was silent, and they turned into Welland Lane,
where their paths presently diverged, and Swithin was left to
pursue his way alone.&nbsp; He might have accompanied the vicar
yet further, and gone straight to Welland House; but it would
have been difficult to do so then without provoking
inquiry.&nbsp; It was easy to go there now: by a cross path he
could be at the mansion almost as soon as by the direct
road.&nbsp; And yet Swithin did not turn; he felt an
indescribable reluctance to see Viviette.&nbsp; He could not
exactly say why.&nbsp; True, before he knew how the land lay it
might be awkward to attempt to call: and this was a sufficient
excuse for postponement.</p>
<p>In this mood he went on, following the direct way to his
grandmother&rsquo;s homestead.&nbsp; He reached the garden-gate,
and, looking into the bosky basin where the old house stood, saw
a graceful female form moving before the porch, bidding adieu to
some one within the door.</p>
<p>He wondered what creature of that mould his grandmother could
know, and went forward with some hesitation.&nbsp; At his
approach the apparition turned, and he beheld, developed into
blushing womanhood, one who had once been known to him as the
village maiden Tabitha Lark.&nbsp; Seeing Swithin, and apparently
from an instinct that her presence would not be desirable just
then, she moved quickly round into the garden.</p>
<p>The returned traveller entered the house, where he found
awaiting him poor old Mrs. Martin, to whose earthly course death
stood rather as the asymptote than as the end.&nbsp; She was
perceptibly smaller in form than when he had left her, and she
could see less distinctly.</p>
<p>A rather affecting greeting followed, in which his grandmother
murmured the words of Israel: &lsquo;&ldquo;Now let me die, since
I have seen thy face, because thou art yet
alive.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>The form of Hannah had disappeared from the kitchen, that
ancient servant having been gathered to her fathers about six
months before, her place being filled by a young girl who knew
not Joseph.&nbsp; They presently chatted with much cheerfulness,
and his grandmother said, &lsquo;Have you heard what a wonderful
young woman Miss Lark has become?&mdash;a mere fleet-footed,
slittering maid when you were last home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>St. Cleeve had not heard, but he had partly seen, and he was
informed that Tabitha had left Welland shortly after his own
departure, and had studied music with great success in London,
where she had resided ever since till quite recently; that she
played at concerts, oratorios&mdash;had, in short, joined the
phalanx of Wonderful Women who had resolved to eclipse masculine
genius altogether, and humiliate the brutal sex to the dust.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is only in the garden,&rsquo; added his
grandmother.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t ye go out and speak to
her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Swithin was nothing loth, and strolled out under the
apple-trees, where he arrived just in time to prevent Miss Lark
from going off by the back gate.&nbsp; There was not much
difficulty in breaking the ice between them, and they began to
chat with vivacity.</p>
<p>Now all these proceedings occupied time, for somehow it was
very charming to talk to Miss Lark; and by degrees St. Cleeve
informed Tabitha of his great undertaking, and of the voluminous
notes he had amassed, which would require so much rearrangement
and recopying by an amanuensis as to absolutely appal him.&nbsp;
He greatly feared he should not get one careful enough for such
scientific matter; whereupon Tabitha said she would be delighted
to do it for him.&nbsp; Then blushing, and declaring suddenly
that it had grown quite late, she left him and the garden for her
relation&rsquo;s house hard by.</p>
<p>Swithin, no less than Tabitha, had been surprised by the
disappearance of the sun behind the hill; and the question now
arose whether it would be advisable to call upon Viviette that
night.&nbsp; There was little doubt that she knew of his coming;
but more than that he could not predicate; and being entirely
ignorant of whom she had around her, entirely in the dark as to
her present feelings towards him, he thought it would be better
to defer his visit until the next day.</p>
<p>Walking round to the front of the house he beheld the
well-known agriculturists Hezzy Biles, Haymoss Fry, and some
others of the same old school, passing the gate homeward from
their work with bundles of wood at their backs. Swithin saluted
them over the top rail.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well! do my eyes and ears&mdash;&rsquo; began Hezzy;
and then, balancing his faggot on end against the hedge, he came
forward, the others following.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Says I to myself as soon as I heerd his voice,&rsquo;
Hezzy continued (addressing Swithin as if he were a disinterested
spectator and not himself), &lsquo;please God I&rsquo;ll pitch my
nitch, and go across and speak to en.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I knowed in a winking &rsquo;twas some great navigator
that I see a standing there,&rsquo; said Haymoss.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But whe&rsquo;r &rsquo;twere a sort of nabob, or a
diment-digger, or a lion-hunter, I couldn&rsquo;t so much as
guess till I heerd en speak.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what changes have come over Welland since I was
last at home?&rsquo; asked Swithin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Mr. San Cleeve,&rsquo; Hezzy replied, &lsquo;when
you&rsquo;ve said that a few stripling boys and maidens have
busted into blooth, and a few married women have plimmed and
chimped (my lady among &rsquo;em), why, you&rsquo;ve said anighst
all, Mr. San Cleeve.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The conversation thus began was continued on divers matters
till they were all enveloped in total darkness, when his old
acquaintances shouldered their faggots again and proceeded on
their way.</p>
<p>Now that he was actually within her coasts again Swithin felt
a little more strongly the influence of the past and Viviette
than he had been accustomed to do for the last two or three
years.&nbsp; During the night he felt half sorry that he had not
marched off to the Great House to see her, regardless of the time
of day.&nbsp; If she really nourished for him any particle of her
old affection it had been the cruellest thing not to call.&nbsp;
A few questions that he put concerning her to his grandmother
elicited that Lady Constantine had no friends about her&mdash;not
even her brother&mdash;and that her health had not been so good
since her return from Melchester as formerly.&nbsp; Still, this
proved nothing as to the state of her heart, and as she had kept
a dead silence since the Bishop&rsquo;s death it was quite
possible that she would meet him with that cold repressive tone
and manner which experienced women know so well how to put on
when they wish to intimate to the long-lost lover that old
episodes are to be taken as forgotten.</p>
<p>The next morning he prepared to call, if only on the ground of
old acquaintance, for Swithin was too straightforward to
ascertain anything indirectly.&nbsp; It was rather too early for
this purpose when he went out from his grandmother&rsquo;s
garden-gate, after breakfast, and he waited in the garden.&nbsp;
While he lingered his eye fell on Rings-Hill Speer.</p>
<p>It appeared dark, for a moment, against the blue sky behind
it; then the fleeting cloud which shadowed it passed on, and the
face of the column brightened into such luminousness that the sky
behind sank to the complexion of a dark foil.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Surely somebody is on the column,&rsquo; he said to
himself, after gazing at it awhile.</p>
<p>Instead of going straight to the Great House he deviated
through the insulating field, now sown with turnips, which
surrounded the plantation on Rings-Hill.&nbsp; By the time that
he plunged under the trees he was still more certain that
somebody was on the tower.&nbsp; He crept up to the base with
proprietary curiosity, for the spot seemed again like his
own.</p>
<p>The path still remained much as formerly, but the nook in
which the cabin had stood was covered with undergrowth.&nbsp;
Swithin entered the door of the tower, ascended the staircase
about half-way on tip-toe, and listened, for he did not wish to
intrude on the top if any stranger were there.&nbsp; The hollow
spiral, as he knew from old experience, would bring down to his
ears the slightest sound from above; and it now revealed to him
the words of a duologue in progress at the summit of the
tower.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mother, what shall I do?&rsquo; a child&rsquo;s voice
said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Shall I sing?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The mother seemed to assent, for the child began&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The robin has fled from the wood<br />
To the snug habitation of man.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This performance apparently attracted but little attention
from the child&rsquo;s companion, for the young voice suggested,
as a new form of entertainment, &lsquo;Shall I say my
prayers?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; replied one whom Swithin had begun to
recognize.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who shall I pray for?&rsquo;</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who shall I pray for?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pray for father.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But he is gone to heaven?&rsquo;</p>
<p>A sigh from Viviette was distinctly audible.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You made a mistake, didn&rsquo;t you, mother?&rsquo;
continued the little one.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must have.&nbsp; The strangest mistake a woman ever
made!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nothing more was said, and Swithin ascended, words from above
indicating to him that his footsteps were heard.&nbsp; In another
half-minute he rose through the hatchway.&nbsp; A lady in black
was sitting in the sun, and the boy with the flaxen hair whom he
had seen yesterday was at her feet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Viviette!&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Swithin!&mdash;at last!&rsquo; she cried.</p>
<p>The words died upon her lips, and from very faintness she bent
her head.&nbsp; For instead of rushing forward to her he had
stood still; and there appeared upon his face a look which there
was no mistaking.</p>
<p>Yes; he was shocked at her worn and faded aspect.&nbsp; The
image he had mentally carried out with him to the Cape he had
brought home again as that of the woman he was now to
rejoin.&nbsp; But another woman sat before him, and not the
original Viviette.&nbsp; Her cheeks had lost for ever that firm
contour which had been drawn by the vigorous hand of youth, and
the masses of hair that were once darkness visible had become
touched here and there by a faint grey haze, like the Via Lactea
in a midnight sky.</p>
<p>Yet to those who had eyes to understand as well as to see, the
chastened pensiveness of her once handsome features revealed more
promising material beneath than ever her youth had done.&nbsp;
But Swithin was hopelessly her junior.&nbsp; Unhappily for her he
had now just arrived at an age whose canon of faith it is that
the silly period of woman&rsquo;s life is her only period of
beauty.&nbsp; Viviette saw it all, and knew that Time had at last
brought about his revenges.&nbsp; She had tremblingly watched and
waited without sleep, ever since Swithin had re-entered Welland,
and it was for this.</p>
<p>Swithin came forward, and took her by the hand, which she
passively allowed him to do.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Swithin, you don&rsquo;t love me,&rsquo; she said
simply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O Viviette!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t love me,&rsquo; she repeated.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t say it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, but I will! you have a right not to love me.&nbsp;
You did once.&nbsp; But now I am an old woman, and you are still
a young man; so how can you love me?&nbsp; I do not expect
it.&nbsp; It is kind and charitable of you to come and see me
here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have come all the way from the Cape,&rsquo; he
faltered, for her insistence took all power out of him to deny in
mere politeness what she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; you have come from the Cape; but not for
me,&rsquo; she answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;It would be absurd if you
had come for me.&nbsp; You have come because your work there is
finished. . . .&nbsp; I like to sit here with my little
boy&mdash;it is a pleasant spot.&nbsp; It was once something to
us, was it not? but that was long ago.&nbsp; You scarcely knew me
for the same woman, did you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Knew you&mdash;yes, of course I knew you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You looked as if you did not.&nbsp; But you must not be
surprised at me.&nbsp; I belong to an earlier generation than
you, remember.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Thus, in sheer bitterness of spirit did she inflict wounds on
herself by exaggerating the difference in their years.&nbsp; But
she had nevertheless spoken truly.&nbsp; Sympathize with her as
he might, and as he unquestionably did, he loved her no
longer.&nbsp; But why had she expected otherwise?&nbsp; &lsquo;O
woman,&rsquo; might a prophet have said to her, &lsquo;great is
thy faith if thou believest a junior lover&rsquo;s love will last
five years!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall be glad to know through your grandmother how
you are getting on,&rsquo; she said meekly.&nbsp; &lsquo;But now
I would much rather that we part.&nbsp; Yes; do not question
me.&nbsp; I would rather that we part.&nbsp; Good-bye.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Hardly knowing what he did he touched her hand, and
obeyed.&nbsp; He was a scientist, and took words literally.&nbsp;
There is something in the inexorably simple logic of such men
which partakes of the cruelty of the natural laws that are their
study.&nbsp; He entered the tower-steps, and mechanically
descended; and it was not till he got half-way down that he
thought she could not mean what she had said.</p>
<p>Before leaving Cape Town he had made up his mind on this one
point; that if she were willing to marry him, marry her he would
without let or hindrance.&nbsp; That much he morally owed her,
and was not the man to demur.&nbsp; And though the Swithin who
had returned was not quite the Swithin who had gone away, though
he could not now love her with the sort of love he had once
bestowed; he believed that all her conduct had been dictated by
the purest benevolence to him, by that charity which
&lsquo;seeketh not her own.&rsquo;&nbsp; Hence he did not flinch
from a wish to deal with loving-kindness towards her&mdash;a
sentiment perhaps in the long-run more to be prized than
lover&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>Her manner had caught him unawares; but now recovering himself
he turned back determinedly.&nbsp; Bursting out upon the roof he
clasped her in his arms, and kissed her several times.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Viviette, Viviette,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I have come
to marry you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She uttered a shriek&mdash;a shriek of amazed joy&mdash;such
as never was heard on that tower before or since&mdash;and fell
in his arms, clasping his neck.</p>
<p>There she lay heavily.&nbsp; Not to disturb her he sat down in
her seat, still holding her fast.&nbsp; Their little son, who had
stood with round conjectural eyes throughout the meeting, now
came close; and presently looking up to Swithin said&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mother has gone to sleep.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Swithin looked down, and started.&nbsp; Her tight clasp had
loosened.&nbsp; A wave of whiteness, like that of marble which
had never seen the sun, crept up from her neck, and travelled
upwards and onwards over her cheek, lips, eyelids, forehead,
temples, its margin banishing back the live pink till the latter
had entirely disappeared.</p>
<p>Seeing that something was wrong, yet not understanding what,
the little boy began to cry; but in his concentration Swithin
hardly heard it.&nbsp; &lsquo;Viviette&mdash;Viviette!&rsquo; he
said.</p>
<p>The child cried with still deeper grief, and, after a
momentary hesitation, pushed his hand into Swithin&rsquo;s for
protection.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush, hush! my child,&rsquo; said Swithin
distractedly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of you!&nbsp; O
Viviette!&rsquo; he exclaimed again, pressing her face to
his.</p>
<p>But she did not reply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What can this be?&rsquo; he asked himself.&nbsp; He
would not then answer according to his fear.</p>
<p>He looked up for help.&nbsp; Nobody appeared in sight but
Tabitha Lark, who was skirting the field with a bounding
tread&mdash;the single bright spot of colour and animation within
the wide horizon.&nbsp; When he looked down again his fear
deepened to certainty.&nbsp; It was no longer a mere surmise that
help was vain.&nbsp; Sudden joy after despair had touched an
over-strained heart too smartly.&nbsp; Viviette was dead.&nbsp;
The Bishop was avenged.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
